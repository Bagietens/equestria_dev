stalliongrad.1.t:0 "Home of the Revolution"
stalliongrad.1.d:0 "More than a decade ago, the great revolutionary named Steel Stallion sparked a revolt in the city of Stalliongrad, one of the poorest regions in Equestria. They dreamed of forming a country with a completely new economic and social system, where everypony is given equal opportunity, where everypony receives everything according to their needs. The revolt spread like wildfire and received support from the surrounding cities and villages. Equestrian officials were sent to quell the rebellion when the independence of the Republic of Stalliongrad was announced. The Equestrian army command could not tolerate it and, in several hours, the Equestrian Royal Army entered the territory of the young republic. The war continued for less than a week before Princess Celestia personally ordered her troops to stop their advance. Several generals were fired from their posts for their aggressive actions. With hopes of a brighter future, the determined ponies of Stalliongrad continue their struggle."

stalliongrad.131.d:0 "Comrades! The working people of Stalliongrad!\n\nWe face an enemy more terrible than bourgeois plutocracy. Monsters, whose motives are the same as those of an animal - endless hunger and bloodthirsty cruelty.\n\nThat is why today, our duty is a sacred war against this abomination.\n\nWithout the official declaration of war to the representatives of the chitinous imperialists, our divisions have already started the liberation of the lands occupied by Changelings, bearing not only the liberation to workers, but spreading our word as well - a word about true equality, order and justice. This is a great day when our ideology will finally reveal its true essence - the essence of the protector of all people and the civilisation itself.\n\nOur region has always been famous for the harsh, cold climate that caused our ancestors to suffer - but one day we tamed nature, we changed it, adapting it to our own needs. Remember the years of oppression under the deceitful Goddesses, when days and nights we worked for them, but there were no real social guarantees - only hypocritical dogmas about illusory Harmony. Remember what difficulties we encountered during the revolutionary war, and after it - when all the "civilised" nations in one moment exposed their plutocratic face, trying to destroy our righteous society by the most heinous methods. But we overcame these difficulties - we became strong and proud as never. And now, we full of determination to achieve new peak and conquer new fortresses.\n\nThis is a necessary war, it is a war that under no circumstances could be avoided. History always requires us to choose: life or death, freedom or slavery. Let the whole world see in our working people heroes who purge the whole continent from the aggression of those cruel creatures.\n\nWe will prove our rightness, Comrades! Our time has come!"

Monsters, whose motives are the same as those of an animal - endless hunger and bloodthirsty cruelty.\n\nThat is why today, our duty is not only to defend our motherland, but also bring the justice to this abomination by our sword.\n\nWithout the official declaration of war from the chitinous imperialists, their divisions have already entered our land. Now we must answer them with our steel determination.\n\nRemember who you are, proud Stalliongradians! We are a people who have thrown off the heavy chains of Equestrian exploitation. We have become a country of true democracy, freedom and order. Our technologies, our industry and our powerful weapons are famous all over the world. Knowing this, our cruel enemy intends to capture all our achievements. Bring it to yourself, just like a barbarian, as they really are.\n\nWe must show the true honour and courage of our people, trampling the invaders with the horseshoe straight into the swamps from which they all came. Our determination in the fight against the changeling swarm should be an example for every state in the world.\n\nAllow your rifle to carry the word about our righteous ideology through the counter strike to the abominable bug.\n\nThis is a sacred war; it is a war that under no circumstances could be failed. History always requires us to choose: life or death, freedom or slavery. Let the whole world see in our working people heroes who purge the whole continent from the aggression of those cruel creatures.\n\nStand strong and brave, comrades! We will prevail!"

stalliongrad.133.t:0 "Sinister speaks against Equestrian aggression"
stalliongrad.133.d:0 "Comrades! I want to announce the news as exciting as the great ones. Our righteous socialist country was attacked, and by these actions Equestria finally showed its true face - the disgusting face of the reactionary plutocracy.\n\nA great people such as the Stalliongradians cannot remain in suspense and we are proud to participate in this gigantic struggle which is destined to transform the world geographically, politically and spiritually. Truly, there is taking place today a formidable struggle between two worlds. Never has the history seen a similar drama, a drama in which we are now among the great leading characters.\n\nThe task of the hour is one and only one: To fight, to fight all together. The comradeship between us becomes closer day by day, becomes a way of common life. We are similar enough and different enough to understand each other, to esteem each other mutually, to fuse together all our energies, since the cause is one. No longer can distinctions be made; our enemies do not make any.\n\nThe Equestrian plutocracy are conducting this war with one sole purpose: They want to reduce the globe to the state in which Buffalo State is today. They want all of people to work in order to give the Equestrian Bourgeoisie an another millennium of another name of exploitation - a "Harmony". They want a world of slaves in order to guarantee for the Canterlot aristocracy their five daily digestions. They want to destroy Communism, and under this name they include all the movements such as include Starlight ideology that named as Equality...\n\nNow, comrades, we must fight for the living ones, fight for the future, but also for the dead. We must fight so that the sacrifice of our dead be not in vain, so that the sacrifice of those who fell in the revolutionary war.\n\nThey, the dead, imperiously command us to fight through till victory. We obey."

stalliongrad.134.t:0 "Sinister's speech against capitalist Equestria"
stalliongrad.134.d:0 "Comrades! Heroes of the revolution! Stallions and Fillies of Stalliongrad! An hour appointed by destiny has struck in the heavens of our Motherland.\n\nThe declaration of war has already been delivered to the ambassadors of Equestria. We go to battle against the plutocratic and reactionary "Harmony" of fake goddesses who, at every moment have hindered the advance and have often endangered the very existence of the Stalliongradian people.\n\nRecent historical events can be summarised in the following phrases: promises, threats, blackmail and sabotage. With you the entire world is witness that Communist Stalliongrad has done all that is possible to avoid the torment which is throwing our continent into turmoil; but all was in vain. It would have sufficed to revise the treaties to bring them up to date with the changing needs of the life of our nation and not consider them untouchable for eternity.\n\nBut now all of that belongs to the past. If now today we have decided to face the risks and the sacrifices of a war, it is because the honour, the interests, the future impose an iron necessity, since a great people is truly such if it considers sacred its own duties and not evade the supreme trials which change the course of history.\n\nWe take rifles in hooves to free the working people of all Equestria from exploitation and plutocracy, which in the minds of the masses is indestructible and endless.\n\nThis gigantic struggle is nothing other than a phase in the logical development of our revolution; it is the struggle of peoples that are poor but rich in workers against the exploiters who hold on ferociously to the monopoly off all the riches and all the gold of the world; it is the struggle between our century and two ideas.\n\nProletarian Stalliongrad stands up again, strong, proud, and united as never before. The single order of the day is categorical and obligatory for all. And this order is... Victory! And we will win, in order finally to give a long period of peace with justice to Stalliongrad, to Equestria, and to the world.\n\nComrades!\nThis is a war to end all wars!"

stalliongrad.135.d:0 "Comrades! I think history itself guides us to the role of the liberator of the [From.GetAdjective] proletariat. We, the people of Stalliongrad, see an opportunity to help the class struggle in this country by importing the revolution, strengthening the unity of the proletarians of all countries by destroying the [From.GetNameAdj] exploiters.\n\nOnce we proclaimed ourselves as defenders of the poor and oppressed; and we bound ourselves by sacred duty. It is a duty to protect all the working people from oppression and violence. The time has come to fulfil our promises.\n\nPeople of [From.GetNameDef] will be glad to get rid of the chains of capital with the help of our brave people's army, and then replenish the ranks of fighters with the bourgeoisie of the whole world.\n\nLong live Stalliongrad!
