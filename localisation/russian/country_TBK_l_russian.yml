### Starting Tree ###
 
TBK_art_of_the_deal: "The Art of the Deal"
TBK_art_of_the_deal_desc: "Some ponies would consider the finest art to be the graceful brushstrokes that inhabit a painter's canvas, or maybe the soothing harmonies that fill the walls of a concert hall with on performance night; but for arms dealers Pea Shooter and Vasile Cel Tradat, there is no greater art in the world than the art of the deal."
 
TBK_facade_of_democracy: "The Facade of Democracy"
TBK_facade_of_democracy_desc: "It's an open secret in Tobuck that the government and its stated "democracy" are just an elaborate sham to garner support from nations like Maregypt, when in reality much of the country is governed by authoritarian warlords, and democratically elected officials have little power."
 
TBK_grease_the_wheel: "Greasing the Wheel of Democracy"
TBK_grease_the_wheel_desc: "Even though the elected government holds little power, simply subverting them by use of force would be inexcusable in both the eyes of the people and friendly regimes; as such it sometimes requires a little bit of bribery and blackmail to convince government bureaucrats to sign off on risky legislature, and smile while doing it."

TBK_convincing_legislature: "Pass the Home Act"
TBK_convincing_legislature_desc: "Gives an idea giving bonus to stability and party popularity gain with malus to pp: the republic passes a law that enables free passage between the lands of Tobuck and Zarantia to all citizens, no questions asked."

TBK_expand_republican_guard: "Expand Guard Jurisdiction"
TBK_expand_republican_guard_desc: "Gives an idea giving pp gain bonus and lowers warlord suspicion; Pea forces the republic to pass a bill expanding authority and legal right of the republican guard to control movement within Tobuck. In reality it enables him to control flow of information to the warlords, if only briefly."

TBK_nascent_bureaucracy: "Clean the House"
TBK_nascent_bureaucracy_desc: "Gives flat pp and stability bonus alongside a stack of dirty money; leads to an event where some bureacract wonders about the recent reforms that has seen her workload increased while her boss seems terse, giving to drinking even earlier than usual and without the usual jovialities."

TBK_hope_tobuck: "Three Hurrahs For Tobuck"
TBK_hope_tobuck_desc: "TODO"

TBK_meet_giggle_juice: "The Loveable Drunk"
TBK_meet_giggle_juice_desc: "While effectively a puppet, one of the most important ponies in Tobuck's democracy is a pony named Giggle Juice. A drunkard who lacks actual power, but makes up for it with an abundance of charisma; he's a popular figurehead in the eyes of many, and his support is paramount to maintaining the facade of Democracy." 

TBK_parlay_vasile: "Erstwhile Partner"
TBK_parlay_vasile_desc: "Gives an event where Pea sits down with Vasile to discuss life after Tobuck."

TBK_zarantia_peace_speech: "Peace and Prosperity"
TBK_zarantia_peace_speech_desc: "Gives party popularity and stability; Giggle Juice gives a speech written by Vasily about how Tobuck and Zarantia have no qualms and can co-exist, come high or low water. He even invites the queen over for a drink and chat. Could lead to also an event for this speech?"

TBK_early_pay_day: "Their Pay Day"
TBK_early_pay_day_desc: "After thoroughly touching base with everypony that props up our make-believe democracy, it's time for them to reap the benefits of their loyalty. After all, we want it to be pretty clear that allegiance is an investment that pays dividends."

TBK_our_pay_day: "Our Pay Day"
TBK_our_pay_day_desc: "The rules have been set, the sellers regulated and the offshore accounts maintained. We're fit to rake in cash for as long as our supply lasts, come Tatarus or high water."

TBK_thanks_for_bits: "Goodbye, And Thanks For the Bits"
TBK_thanks_for_bits_desc: "Completing this focus will end the Pea Shooter money part early, giving him an additional personal wealth bonus for handing over Tobuck earlier than laid down in the deal."

TBK_pr_campaign: "To The Citizens of Tobuck!"
TBK_pr_campaign_desc: "Stability increase + lowers warlord suspicion; Pea, with help of Giggle, launches a massive pr campaign to calm the populace and soldiers amongst the warlords about the recent reforms."

TBK_please_listen: "Do Not Believe Their Lies!"
TBK_please_listen_desc: "Resets warlord suspicion; the media begins to counter spreading lies and rumours actively, going as far as to defame by name known critics."

TBK_to_each_their_game: "To Each Their Game"
TBK_to_each_their_game_desc: "A free market is good for business, but there is a such thing as it being too free. With a little bookkeeping and regulation we can ensure that only loyal liaisons and captains are shipping our guns around, and that none of them are sold to local warlords that could try to muscle in on the trade."

TBK_checking_the_supply: "Checking the Supply"
TBK_checking_the_supply_desc: "Gives access to a better gun salvaging mission; should be about Pea with his aides calculating and checking the amount of guns remaining based on estimation."

TBK_quality_products: "Quality Products"
TBK_quality_products_desc: "One of the most important things an arms dealer maintains is his reputation. Sell defective arms to a customer one too many times and you may as well consider yourself out of a job. On the other hoof, certain firearms are precisely hunted for their qualities, whenever exceptional or historical. It'd be a waste to sell them off to a common buyer and leave a wealthy patron miffed."

TBK_business_of_gun_running: "The Business of Gun Running"
TBK_business_of_gun_running_desc: "Arms trafficking is the bread and butter of Tobuck. It's why the government was founded, how it's funded, why it's leaders even care, and ultimately the glue that binds Tobuckian society together. On top of all that, it makes us extremely rich!" 

TBK_meeting_the_banker: "Meeting With the Banker"
TBK_meeting_the_banker_desc: "One of the most important part of Tobuck's gun trade is offshore bank accounts; Tobuck is not a state with a stable economy. Storing our accumulated wealth in local banks is just asking for it to be lost with the next financial crisis, which is why it's important to regularly meet with overseas bankers to maintain foreign accounts."
 
TBK_performance_review: "Performance Review"
TBK_performance_review_desc: "With ample use of auditors and statisticians, we can actually get to the business of determining if all of our hard work has actually paid off in the end, or if we've just wasted our time with bad business."

TBK_streamlined_procurement: "Streamlined Procurement"
TBK_streamlined_procurement_desc: "Lowers the timer for the missions at cost of pp; in short, Pea streamlines the arms gathering through reformed catalogue system and expanded workforce."

TBK_eye_on_warlords: "The Three Warlords"
TBK_eye_on_warlords_desc: "Gives some stability and popularity; Pea knows he has to keep the warlords distracted in order for them to not discover the deal with Zarantia. Therefore he must be ready to play ball with them just a little bit longer."

TBK_celebrate_military_success: "Celebrate Military Success"
TBK_celebrate_military_success_desc: "Lowers warlord suspicion; Pea organises shipments of food and drinks to the warlords under the pretext of celebrating their success in defending Tobuck."

TBK_rules_gun_running: "The Rules of Good Business"
TBK_rules_gun_running_desc: "Gives pp and lowers supremacy popularity; just a flavour description detailing how gunrunning has certain rules that any succesfull smuggler ought to follow or they will perish."

TBK_first_rule: "First Rule"
TBK_first_rule_desc: "First rule is to never get shot with your own merchandise. Sell it unloaded, and sell it to people way out of killing range. Wallnut Drive is a true oddball compared to the other warlords, someone who seems to find new ways to break guns and expend ammunition."

TBK_tricky_thestral: "The Tricky Thestral"
TBK_tricky_thestral_desc: "Wallnut Drive is not the smartest bat, but he has a way of showing up just when you don't need him to. If given the right incentives, he'll cause enough chaos and confusion on his own that the others won't realize the game until it's already up."

TBK_second_rule: "Second Rule"
TBK_second_rule_desc: "Second rule is to never pick up arms with your customers. Baragzen, the snobby Warzenan  noble, has far greater ambitions than any other warlord in Tobuck, only outmatched by his boorish smugness. But passion like his, if harnessed well, makes for a good tool."

TBK_exiled_royal: "The Exiled Royal"
TBK_exiled_royal_desc: "Baragzen sees Tobuck as just a stepping stone to future conquests. Let him think that way. We'll give him some extra guns and tell him the other warlords are looking to muscle in on his territory, and he'll keep them off our backs."

TBK_third_rule: "Third Rule"
TBK_third_rule_desc: "Third rule is to always ensure you have a foolproof way of getting paid, preferably in advance. If you don't have a guaranteed way to get your cash in the end, the deal isn't worth it. Alesia Snezhnaya is a smart mare and careful with her goods. But give her a good deal and she'll make a good business partner."

TBK_white_severyana: "The White Severyanian"
TBK_white_severyana_desc: "Alesia Snezhnaya is dogged and determined, but thinks linearly. If we hand her some extra troops and tell her to fortify the border, she'll be too busy scrupulously digging trenches to snoop around."

TBK_failure_operation: "Erstwhile Operation"
TBK_failure_operation_desc: "Lowers warlord suspicion, will damage warlord divisions and lower stability; a skirmish is launched against Chiropterra using warlord units but it naturally ends in failure. Gives Chiropterra an event giving some free labourers?"

TBK_provoke_battles: "Tobuckian Standoff"
TBK_provoke_battles_desc: "Greatly lowers supremacy support; Pea pokes the hornets nest in just the right way to cause a brief threeway battle between the warlords' soldiers, turning their attention elsewhere."

### Vasile tree

TBK_vasile_start: "To Save the Republic"
TBK_vasile_start_desc: "Well that was a mess. Pea's off. Zarantia's angrier than they ever have been and the warlords are running amok in the countryside. But while you can see some smugglers running to the ships in Tobuck's harbour, there is a griff in the presidential palace who still sees an opportunity. After all, who better to thrive in chaos than a Brodfeldian?"

TBK_take_loans: "Grovel For Loans"
TBK_take_loans_desc: "Pea drained the whole treasury dry to fund his escape. Whatever he made it out with is gone and so is the rest. At this point, we'll have to bite the bullet and borrow at loan shark rates but it beats austerity. Nothing is more unstable than corrupt civil servants getting told to make do with less."

TBK_crash_cuts: "Crash Cuts"
TBK_crash_cuts_desc: "Whoever said that you have to spend money to make money was not in the gun running business. While you can haggle with some ponies, you can't expect to go far with the loan shark breathing down your neck. Anyway, everypony takes a squeeze and be a little patient. If you want guarantees and security, go plant potatoes!"

TBK_support_zarantian_businesses: "Entice the Zarantians"
TBK_support_zarantian_businesses_desc: "Throughout Pea's regime, we took very little care in giving a reason for the Zarantian-aligned families not to hate us. Considering Pea's end game, it was no surprise but Vasile had nonetheless made some business overtures. By reaching out, we could build a relationship off of that. And once we're in, we can work things out."

TBK_blame_pea: "Everything Is Pea's Fault!"
TBK_blame_pea_desc: "Pea Shooter was a fantastic gun smuggler but he really mucked it up for the rest of us. We'll be lucky if we manage to really turn things around. Luckily, the Tobuckians feel the same way. So we might as well pin everything on him. He's far away and not planning to come back. He'll understand. Probably."

TBK_blame_giggle: "And Giggle's Too!"
TBK_blame_giggle_desc: "Giggle Juice was an amazing tool for a while when Pea's crew was still getting money and some good partying was enough to smooth the edges. But now, we're going to go through a rough patch and nothing gets on the nerves of everypony than a drunk who can't get up before noon. Time to sober up."

TBK_vasile_president: "Emergency Elections"
TBK_vasile_president_desc: "For all of its short history, the Republic of Tobuck never made good on its promise of organising elections. So let's. We'll have to be quick about it so no opposition can organise. Also, we'll need to raid the pantries to buy votes with something else than money. Hey you! Want a pound of flour in exchange for a vote?"

TBK_restore_legitimacy: "Bring Back Stability"
TBK_restore_legitimacy_desc: "For a little while, we have been able to keep the rowdiest elements of our mercenaries and smugglers in check. Now, they're running wild and anypony turning to the state needs to pay up to even get listened to. It's time to bring back some order and show them that maybe there's hope under the striped flag. At the very least, it'll buy us time to figure things out."

TBK_reform_and_expand_republican_guard: "Arm the Republican Guard"
TBK_reform_and_expand_republican_guard_desc: "The Republic Guard has never been much more than a ponyguard force dedicated to prevent the warlords from bullying the capital itself. It is time to give them the tools to do more and actually stand up to the warlords when the time is right. We have the guns. Time to give them to the right ponies this time around."

TBK_keep_some_servants: "Keep Some Bureaucrats"
TBK_keep_some_servants_desc: "Vasile and Pea paid a whole lot of ponies throughout their partnership. Sadly, both indulged in some favoritism, especially when Pea's plan became clear. The people wants corrupt heads to fall. Might as well give them what they want with Pea's loyalists and make sure we get to keep the loyal ones who know what they're doing."

TBK_cull_civil_servants: "Sweep the Slate Clean"
TBK_cull_civil_servants_desc: "For all its usefulness for our business venture, the corrupt apparel of state was a really nothing more than a temporary boon. It's a rotten base for anything long-term. We need to remove all of the corrupt civil servants and make sure those with real inside knowledge shut up permanently. Plus, this will be a wonderful opportunity to garner good among the people."

TBK_fight_warlords: "Act Swiftly and Fiercely"
TBK_fight_warlords_desc: "It's been months now that the three idiots and other new wannabe idiots have been ducking it out in the countryside to be in a prime position to take Tobuck. In a way, they made our job for us. Time to go out and mop them up before the bats or Zarantians get the idea of doing it first. Citizens, to arms! Or something like that. We're learning."

TBK_vasile_inaguration_speech: "Father of the Fatherland"
TBK_vasile_inaguration_speech_desc: "The votes have been counted and the elected parliament of Tobuck can finally gather. Thanks to our diligence, it's only a formality and Vasile Cel Tradat shall be confirmed as president of the Republic. It's time to address the people. Fear not, little foals of Tobuck. Vasile's here. And he'll take good care of you. We promise."

TBK_legimate_republic: "Republic of the People"
TBK_legimate_republic_desc: "You know what? If we are to make this republican thing work, we might as well walk the walk. Well. Up to a point. But still, we can find a way to make things work for the people and for us. In addition, it would finally allow us to make good on our plan to give us a presentable facade for the harmonic and established powers. After all, all facades are better with an actual building behind it."

TBK_shore_up_defences: "Sign the National Defence Bill"
TBK_shore_up_defences_desc: "For a while, the warlords formed a fine line of defense. Enough well-armed crazies to make our neighbours think twice about grabbing the big prize. But now, we'll have to provide for our own defense to fend off any attackers. Vasile has the will to do it. But how to go about it? That is the million bit question."

TBK_raise_extra_troops: "Call Upon the People"
TBK_raise_extra_troops_desc: "With the promise of a more respectable republic, we can start recruiting among the general population without fear of angering our military leaders. With a decent pay, we can even hope that enough will answer the call to fill up our ranks. It'll take time of course to build a standing army capable of defending Tobuck but it'll be ours. Plus, we know how to find enough guns to make even the lowest recruit a threat."

TBK_rally_front: "Together For Victory!"
TBK_rally_front_desc: "Gone are the days of the warlords and mercenaries. You won't be fighting so Pea Shooter can loot you for longer but for a square deal. Everypony gets their share. We're fighting for our homes and our families. This is Tobuck and it is not for sale! So gather around and grab a gun."

TBK_bat_forts: "The Western Trenches"
TBK_bat_forts_desc: "Chief among our threatening neighbours stands Chiropterra in the west. With Wallnut Drive's luck and tactics gone, we need to find new ways to counter them. Fortunately, we do have some veterans whose experience we can use. But considering the size of Tobuck, we have no other choice than to dig and entrench ourselves to start. Here's a shovel."

TBK_bat_defence: "Together Against the Bat Menace"
TBK_bat_defence_desc: "You know what's worse than smugglers, warlords and corruption? Bats. They're crazy, they're evil and they hate anything even remotely pleasurable. It's been a thousand years and they're still not over their insane alicorn mother issues. They'll ban sunlight and ask you to thank them for it. So choose wisely. Choose the lesser evil. Choose Tobuck."

TBK_hire_additional_mercs: "Hire the Band of Flayers"
TBK_hire_additional_mercs_desc: "We need forces loyal to the new republic in order to stabilize our still fragile rule, and to get the Chiropterrans off our backs. While we want to phase out the use of mercenaries and warlords eventually, we need to bring in some new muscle to keep the peace. The barbaric "Band of Flayers" and their fearsome reputation, including rumors of skinning victims, will be the perfect force to scare those fanatics off."

TBK_use_merc_experiences: "Utilize Mercenary Experiences"
TBK_use_merc_experiences_desc: "You know what's great about mercenaries? They know how to kill things. They'll tell you about it. The important thing is to discard the moral quandaries and take the free lesson. So as long as we're hiring them, we might as well put them to good use. Now if only they would pick up after themselves."

TBK_criminal_republic: "Republic of Riches"
TBK_criminal_republic_desc: "All the way back when the striped flag was raised over Tobuck, Vasile felt in his bones that this was a good hustle. Not in the way Pea had envisioned. We need not steal everything that isn't nailed down. Rather, we can milk this republic. Politics can be a racket just as much as war is. Time to do some... career reorientation."

### Post-Chiropterra War Legimate tree

TBK_vasile_post_bat_legimate: "Our Triumphant Republic"
TBK_vasile_post_bat_legimate_desc: "It's over. The bats are in disarray and Vasile stands triumphant, our president-conqueror. In just a few years, we transformed a fake republic into a model for Zebrica, a profitable democracy, and now, we'll do it again for the fanatics! We're not the emotional type but it does bring a tear to your eye. Take that Kemerskai!"

TBK_bat_break_faith: "What Did Wallnut Say Again?"
TBK_bat_break_faith_desc: "From the beginning, we've had a window, if a bit of a foggy one, into how Chiropterra operates and what we've seen is not pretty. And that's us saying that so you catch the drift. If left alone, the madness will bite us in the tail. We need to neuter the Moonspeaker operation and make sure that from this day forward, they'll be shooting blanks even on a full moon!"

TBK_bat_leave_mommy_issues_be: "Just... Leave Faith Be"
TBK_bat_leave_mommy_issues_be_desc: "Look. They've been weird about it for a thousand years so maybe it's better that we just find a way to accommodate it all. Maybe teach them a few lessons about healthy management of expectations and pick up something like painting. We'll just make sure the Moonspeakers don't get too murderous. That'll be a start."

TBK_bat_peaceful: "Chill and Eat Mangoes"
TBK_bat_peaceful_desc: "Religion is obviously a root issue of why Chiropterra acted the way it did. However, we can't just ignore the result of a millennia of cultural stiffness. We need to sell to the bats the idea that there is more to life than war and moon, that they can just have fun. And we know a thing or two about how to sell something to a pony."

TBK_bat_moneys: "Tributes of the Moon"
TBK_bat_moneys_desc: "The Chiropterra war has been a costly endeavour and they've long caused untold sorrow and property damages. It's high time that they start paying reparations to those they've harmed. Well, to us for a start. Let's not upset the hierarchy of creditors. We don't forget our brave veterans or those who provided them with the tools of war."

TBK_bat_determine_guilt: "Guilty, Not Guilty..."
TBK_bat_determine_guilt_desc: "Throughout its history, Chiropterra has committed so much crime it's not even funny anymore. And that's just according to their archives. So if we want to make sure the angry victims are calmed down, we'll need to go through all of it and figure out who gets a bullet, a cell, a ticket to wherever or slapped with a fine and hoof so we can call it a day."

TBK_bat_old_stooges_new_management: "Old System, New Management"
TBK_bat_old_stooges_new_management_desc: "Look, Canterlot wasn't built in a day and we don't have a millenia on our hooves. We barely managed to build a republic once and that was without a cult to deal with. So we'll do the best thing a good leader can do: passing the buck! Er, I mean delegate to the right ponies and let them figure all that stuff out. They'll manage."

TBK_bat_democracy: "Traditional-Moon Party"
TBK_bat_democracy_desc: "Look, we know. But that one has been such a winning brand, we can't just go and not use it. In all honesty, the TMP has a nice ring to it and they need some reassurance that no, we're not trying to besiege the gates of the moon. Also, they're paying us anyway so we might as well give them a little something for all the royalties we're getting."

TBK_bat_chiropterra_republic: "New Lunar Republic"
TBK_bat_chiropterra_republic_desc: "President Vasile never meant to conquer and occupy foreign land, merely to liberate them and put an end to a criminal regime. Now, the new and improved Lunar Republic stands proud in Chiropterra, ready to engage with the world in good faith and absolutely no trace of terrorism. Ain't that swell? Why is there somepony wheezing in the back?"

TBK_vasile_popular_autocracy: "Vasile the Victorious"
TBK_vasile_popular_autocracy_desc: "As the sun rises over the dank chiropterran hills, president Vasile stands alone and victorious and yet, some still have some doubts about him. Why? Hasn't he achieved the impossible? We have had so much success it's starting to get physically painful. Especially for our enemies. Poor them. So let's party. Lack of gratitude is best handled the morning after."

TBK_centralize_presidency: "One And Only President"
TBK_centralize_presidency_desc: "The road to our current success was a bumpy ones, with all kinds of needs to compromise, play nice and prove ourselves. Well, we've proven ourselves and it is high time that ponies stop pretending like president Vasile doesn't deserve his place. How about you all prove yourselves to him? What have you ever done for Tobuck?!"

TBK_who_saved_you: "Who Saved You?"
TBK_who_saved_you_desc: "We've spend so much time fighting for our lives that we have not really told the story of how it all went down. But in the end. Where was Tobuck when president Vasile took over? Surrounded by bloodthirsty enemies, torn apart by warlords and looted by a criminal. So ask yourselves, all the critics, how did we get here from there?"

TBK_who_made_you_wealthy: "Who Made You Rich?"
TBK_who_made_you_wealthy_desc: "It is true that Tobuck has always been well-developed but that wealth was always built on playing second fiddle for foreign rulers by families with little pride in their own people. So what did the Brodfeldian do? He did not export the wealth, he expanded it right here. He made Tobuck rich on its own terms and it's all trickling down back to you all."

TBK_sideline_harmonists: "What´s Good In Friendship?"
TBK_sideline_harmonists_desc: "What did the harmonists ever do for you? Did they feed you when you were hungry? Did they stand against Chiropterra when they loomed over us? Did they provide you with jobs? No. All they do is chatter and bicker about the right of law. Well, the law says Vasile Cel Tradat is the president of the republic and the law is right."

TBK_i_am_republic: "I Am the Republic"
TBK_i_am_republic_desc: "There, we said our piece and we're not hearing any retort. This concludes our national debate. So if you didn't pay attention, here's the main takeaway. This Republic rests upon the president's mighty shoulders and you all better be afraid of what would happen if Vasile Cel Tradat ever shrugged! Thanks for listening and get back to work."

TBK_symbols_presidency: "Idol of the Republic"
TBK_symbols_presidency_desc: "A great problem in Tobuck is that it never had a real story of its own, symbols or a mythology to explain why it is so great. In a way, it lacks a brand. And who better than president Vasile to be the face of it? So let's codify the presidency and elevate his game changing achievements. We'll call it all Vasilism. Sure rhymes with patriotism."

TBK_final_arbitrator: "Now You Sit and\n Listen To Me"
TBK_final_arbitrator_desc: "We've had to compromise way too much for too little gain during the early years of the presidency. We let the opposition in parliament and the media sling dirt at anypony. But in the end, it was our great president Vasile who lead us to victory and prosperity. So let's cut to the chase and listen. You all might learn a thing or two!"

TBK_supreme_protector: "Hear My Pledge"
TBK_supreme_protector_desc: "The candidate is chosen and Vasile's place in Tobuck's national myth is enshrined. So it may be time for the president to address the nation and to explain what his role is. That of a father, a father who knows that it's time for his little foals to spread their wings, to trot out of the nest and fly into the sunset. Ok, we'll keep working on that but the gist is there."

TBK_prime_minister_idea: "Perhaps I Work Too Much?"
TBK_prime_minister_idea_desc: "You know what? One can in fact suffer from success. There is something about open leadership that just drains you. Perhaps it's time to look for an heir. Well, at least a new face to throw at the press so the president can focus on the good thing in life : prestige, money and business. Preferably all at once."

TBK_perfect_servant: "My Most Loyal Aide"
TBK_perfect_servant_desc: "Vasile Cel Tradat has been a great president and achieved much. Nopony can deny that, especially not the one who wrote it all down. So who better to take the reins than his secretary? Bean Counter, the shy little pony who crunched the numbers for so many reforms. The good thing is that he's used to taking orders so he'll do great."

TBK_establish_office_prime_minister: "Congratulations\nPrime Minister!"
TBK_establish_office_prime_minister_desc: "Now that we've done some spring cleaning, it's high time to make things official. So congratulations, Bean Counter! You are now the head of government, serving at the president's leisure and responsible before parliament. And if it doesn't work out, Vasile will dismiss and replace him. That's how it works in a democracy, right? "

TBK_democratic_principles: "Soul of the State"
TBK_democratic_principles_desc: "Tobuck is a republic but it's always been run on promises and Vasile's careful maneuvering. However, it's not enough to walk the walk, the people wants to hear the right words too. So it's time to enshrine the principles of liberty and democracy within our constitution. With some guardrails of course. Don't want the crazies storming into office, now do we?"

TBK_tcp_supremacy: "Forwards Tobuck, Follow the TCP!"
TBK_tcp_supremacy_desc: "Vasile has done a lot for the nation but in truth, it was always a team effort. And that team is the Traditional Center Party. The TCP stands for liberty, for democracy, for prosperity and for victory! Bean Counter is the party chancellor and Vasile Cel Tradat its esteemed founder! So get in or get lost! Er, I mean, get in for Tobuck! Hurray."

TBK_tcp_propaganda: "There Is No Tobuck Without the TCP!"
TBK_tcp_propaganda_desc: "The party has never been the most active. So time to shake things up if we're going to make it for election day. Get your fat tails out of your sofas and start campaigning! Ring some bells, shake hooves and smile! Don't know how to do that? Grab some pamphlets and give them out! No, you're not getting paid for this! Your job is on the line!"

TBK_electoral_gamble: "Luck Never Dies"
TBK_electoral_gamble_desc: "The harmonic opposition constantly rants and rave about a free and fair election. And you know what? We're in. Let's do this. Let's have an election. A fair one. A quick one. What do they even have to offer that we don't? We've got the money, we've got the results, we've got the best candidate. Then again, it's a gamble but eh, we got this."

TBK_meet_opposition: "Shake Claw With Rose"
TBK_meet_opposition_desc: "Rose Rain. Leader of the Harmonic Front. It was such a cute idea that, allegedly, Pea Shooter sent a fruit basket when she had her first public meeting. However, she did manage to win over some ponies and is formally the head of our opposition. If we're going to make the people buy into this election, it's time to acknowledge her."

TBK_formalize_election_rigging: "One Citizen,\nOne Vote"
TBK_formalize_election_rigging_desc: "On paper, an election is something that is extremely simple. You vote and whoever gets the most votes wins. However, even the worst student of political science could tell you that there are finer details that can alter the outcome of an election and that the definition of winning is relative. We agree. So let's get to work on th"

TBK_citizen_fears: "Only Vasile Protects Your Interests, Citizen!"
TBK_citizen_fears_desc: "You know. Ponies are not really that dumb. They know that Vasile has some unsavory dealings here and there. But what about Rose? What was she doing? And what of the other candidates? All these politicians, do we know what they were doing during Pea's days? Meanwhile, you know Vasile and things are good. But the others? Can you trust them?"

TBK_sham_electoral_victory: "Three Hurrays To Victory"
TBK_sham_electoral_victory_desc: "Alright. Election day. What a blast this campaign has been. President cel Tradat has toured the nation with great success but now comes the moment of truth. I know we've stacked the deck but I'm starting to feel that the harmonists are onto something with this whole election thing. I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS ALIVE!"

TBK_entry_world_stage: "Enter the World"
TBK_entry_world_stage_desc: "Well. State building? Check. Defeat the lunatics? Check. Sounds like “this pompous griff from Brodfeld” has more than an ace in his sleeve, doesn't it? Now that we have proven ourselves, it is time to bring our unparalleled abilities to the worldstage. Call in the translators. And a few crates of the best Aquileian wines. We don't want to be rude now, do we?"

TBK_warzena_choice: "What To Do With Warzena?"
TBK_warzena_choice_desc: "For as long as we've been independent and allegedly since Zarantia conquered Tobuck, Warzena has been a stick in the mud.

They can't be any preachier than Equestria, right?"

TBK_maregypt_deal: "In the Land of Pyramids"

TBK_zarantia_recourse: "No Hard Feelings Zarantia?"
TBK_zarantia_recourse_desc: "So what if we offered you a deal you couldn't refuse and then asked you to shove it where the sun don't shine? That was all Pea Shooter and now we're brand new.

TBK_share_bat_horrors: "Lemme Tell You About Chiropterra!"
TBK_share_bat_horrors_desc: "One of the few times when Wallnut gets real quiet and serious is when talking about Chiropterra. It's a terrible place.

If there's one thing Wallnut Drive knows, it's that they must be stopped."

TBK_no_chains: "No Chains!"

We shall make a plublic declaration of our intentions to install the rightful king of Warzena, both to the public and to our enemy."

TBK_i_am_king: "The Abjuration Decree"
TBK_i_am_king_desc: "Baragzen's first law for the new realm is the Abjuration Decree. All power vested in government officials is to be subsumed by his will and whim, under no circumstances must this rule be ignored. Any remnants of Pea Shooter's republic will be eliminated for good."

TBK_secure_river_border: "The Demarean Embankments"
TBK_secure_river_border_desc: "Unlike his contemporary warlord commanders, Baragzen expresses no displeasure at the concept of flooding particular areas for the sake of defensive proficiency. If Chiropterra wishes to invade, then they shall meet a well prepared and dangerous foe."

TBK_alesia_start: "The White Severyan"
TBK_alesia_start_desc: "Through iron will and decisive action, Alesia Snezhnaya has emerged the dominant power in Tobuck. While the other warlords are cowed, she must find one of them to make a pact with and dispose of the other."

TBK_subdue_locals: "Righteous Rule"
TBK_subdue_locals_desc: "The Severyan tsars of old ruled with justice and fairness, but also cold efficiency. They had no time for foolish things like mercy, or forgiving those who deserved no forgiveness. Alesia will emulate their example, and crush the rebellious scum and the criminals of Tobuck in one swift blow."

TBK_evil_communism: "The Red Beast"
TBK_evil_communism_desc: "The one saving grace of Tobuck is that the godless venom of communism hasn't infected it. Alesia intends to keep it that way, and to use her new state as a hammer against the ravening red hordes."

TBK_defenders_traditions: "White Druzhina"
TBK_defenders_traditions_desc: "Now that Alesia has broken the deadlock of smugglers, warlords, and miscreants, she can centralize and discipline this rabble into a proper army. The first step is redistributing Alesia's loyal troops into the ranks of new regiments, where they will serve as instructors and discipline officers. These mixed Severyan-Tobuckian units will be the Druzhina, and the other units should strive to emulate them."

TBK_all_for_defence: "All For Triumph!"
TBK_all_for_defence_desc: "Resolute stoicism, unyielding determination, uncomplaining sacrifice. These were the values which made Severyana strong before the communist cancer rotted them away, and these are the values Alesia will instill by her example."

TBK_long_from_home: "It's Long Way To Princessyn"
TBK_long_from_home_desc: "The white exiles are few in number, but every single one of them is worth ten other ponies. Alesia will call upon old contacts and allies among the last true Severyans, and rekindle the dream of a new Severyana among them. One day, we shall return, and bring fire and death to the bloodthirsty beasts who despoil our lands."

TBK_new_exile_regiment: "We Are Severyan Soldiers"
TBK_new_exile_regiment_desc: "The advantage of coming to power in Tobuck is that it is a cultural blank slate. Thanks to this, we have been able to foster Severyan values of stoicism, sacrifice, hierarchy, and discipline among our soldiers, with no need to uproot an inferior service culture. The tales of Severyan heroes of old shall inspire our troops, and they will show the rabble of this continent what true warfare is!"

TBK_contact_kin: "The Exiled Community"
TBK_contact_kin_desc: "Alesia was already well-known among the Severyan exiles, and as news of her victory has spread more and more of her compatriots have begun to feel the old flames of patriotism rekindle. Some of the old nobility managed to escape with significant wealth, and now many of them are making generous donations to our cause."

TBK_severyan_family: "Severyana Endures Through Us"
TBK_severyan_family_desc: "Severyana may have fallen, first to the scheming princess and then to the vile communists, but so long as one true Severyanian draws breath it is not lost. Alesia will rule with the same rigid strength as the tsars of old, and muster her forces until, one day, the true foals of Severyana will return to drive out the parasites who feast on their homeland."

TBK_i_hate_sand: "I Hate Sand"
TBK_i_hate_sand_desc: "There is nothing worse than desert warfare. However, given Pea Shooter's machinations we will likely have to face the Zarantian savages sooner rather than later. Alesia has declared that we will construct a line of fortifications along their border, complete with minefields and concealed killzones, such that by the time we step into the desert there will only be corpses waiting for us."

TBK_full_war_economy: "All the Guns and Bullets"
TBK_full_war_economy_desc: "Our first priority should be getting guns into hooves. We'll use the remainder of the smugglers' ill-gotten-gains to purchase as many weapons as we can find, and scour the city to dredge up its hidden stashes. After that, we'll have to make our own."

TBK_pay_troops: "All Possible Troops"
TBK_pay_troops_desc: "Our first priority should be to get more hooves to hold guns. We will increase soldiers' pay to incentivize as many to enlist as possible, then extend conscription to make up the difference with draftees."

TBK_new_tobuck: "Death of Tobuck"
TBK_new_tobuck_desc: "The Republic of Tobuck was a sham state from the start. Few marked its passing, and fewer still will mourn it. It is time to formally bury the republic, so that our new order can begin in earnest."

TBK_dusk_wane_start:0 "Voices of the Workers"
TBK_dusk_wane_start_desc:0 "With the defeat of Chiropterra, Tobuck has become more than just another minor state in Zebrica. The work is far from done, however. Having convinced Wallnut to adopt a socialist government, Dusk Wane must now tackle the issues that plague the working class of the newly formed United Lands of Northern Zebrica."

TBK_dusk_labour_front:0 "United Labour Front"
TBK_dusk_labour_front_desc:0 "Ensuring that the common worker feels safe at home and work should be the ultimate goal of any worthwhile socialist nation; with happy workers comes a prosperous state, after all. At Dusk's recommendation, Wallnut has signed off on the creation of an official state-run union: the United Labour Front."

TBK_convince_temples:0 "Sanctuaries of Communities"
TBK_convince_temples_desc:0 "The ponies of Chiropterra are afraid of what we will do to their temples now that we control them. Wallnut had originally wanted them all torn down, but Dusk Wane has managed to convince him that promising to rebuild and remodel them would lead to a more enthusiastic and agreeable populace."

TBK_old_teachings:0 "The Ancient Moon"
TBK_old_teachings_desc:0 "A thousand years of brainwashing isn't easy to overcome, and yet when you walk through the streets of New Ayacachtli something peculiar becomes apparent: Ponies are starting to feel less like Chiropterrans and more like citizens of the United Lands of Northern Zebrica. Perhaps in time they will overcome their deep-rooted obsession for Nightmare Moon in favour of the Old Moon as well."

TBK_communal_administration:0 "Out With the Old,\nIn With the Unions!"
TBK_communal_administration_desc:0 "As the workers of Chiropterra grow more and more accustomed to running things themselves, it is only sensical that their fledgling unions should be allowed more control over their daily lives. After all, nobody knows the workers' needs like they themselves do."

TBK_merge_faith_and_unions:0 "The Red Moon Edict"
TBK_merge_faith_and_unions_desc:0 "No more will the Nightmare hold dominion over this land! Let it be known that the Old Moon treats all equally, and so shall we as well! From the meekest of workers to the most respected of union members, all will enjoy a prosperous and more meaningful life!"

TBK_moonspeaker_union:0 "Federated Union of Moonspeakers"
TBK_moonspeaker_union_desc:0 "After we made our intentions to preserve the temples of Chiropterra clear, a group of Moonspeakers informed us that they have created an organization which seeks to help the ponies of Chiropterra come around to Wallnut's administration. All they are asking for are funds to help rebuild the devastated parts of their communities and feed those that are suffering."

TBK_police_union:0 "Commune Constabularies"
TBK_police_union_desc:0 "Though we have achieved victory over the Legionnaires, there are still pockets of fanatical elites causing issues across the countryside. With Wallnut's approval, Dusk Wane will implement police reforms aimed at bringing these criminals to justice."

TBK_social_welfare_system:0 "Welfare Solidarity"
TBK_social_welfare_system_desc:0 "With a new nation comes new issues. Among them, poverty is a particularly severe problem that few like to think about. With the seizure of Chiropterra's treasury, putting some money into the hooves of those who truly need it shouldn't be too difficult."

TBK_extensive_aid:0 "Wholesale Aid"
TBK_extensive_aid_desc:0 "A society and state, no matter how just and righteous, will always have those who fall through the cracks. It is our duty to these creatures to provide them with aid and kindness, as it always was their right to recieve such. From each according to their ability, to each acording to their needs."

TBK_jobs_network:0 "Work For Workless"
TBK_jobs_network_desc:0 "The poorest dregs of a society and state will often find themselves without work and thusly without any way to climb out of the depths in which they languish. We shall establish a collection of offices which can be visited in order to find vacancies in low skill jobs so that they may achieve a semblance of monetary security."

TBK_socialist_healthcare:0 "Communal Clinics"
TBK_socialist_healthcare_desc:0 "The concept of a community doctor is not a new one, but formalising the role of local specialists so that we may aid them with equipment and greater education will allow even the most serious imjuries to be treated at a moment's notice without needing to travel to a city."

TBK_national_identity_card:0 "N.I.C"
TBK_national_identity_card_desc:0 "The National Identity Card system is certainly something that will take our citizens some getting used to. Despite what some may say, Dusk Wane has assured that its purpose is entirely organisational; the intention is to use them to keep track of places of work, marital status and other such things for the sake of record keeping."

TBK_good_food:0 "Superior Food,\nSuperior Workers"
TBK_good_food_desc:0 "Despite our policy of food for all no matter the circumstances, it has been brought to our attention that some of the food going around might be better left uneaten. In response, Wallnut has approved Dusk Wane's proposal to implement a national standard for food products both imported and natively produced or made."

TBK_confiscate_wealth:0 "Fruits of Their Labour"
TBK_confiscate_wealth_desc:0 "Though Chiropterra may have called them "Labourers", these poor ponies have suffered many injustices ranging from being torn away from their families to being forced to serve a goddess that they didn't believe in! The least we can do is offer them their own plot of land and a future that they can decide for themselves."

TBK_labour_union_formations:0 "For the Unions Make Us Strong"
TBK_labour_union_formations_desc:0 "Unions are the backbone of any true socialist nation. Though we have made this an important topic in several meetings, many workers still do not even understand the concept of a union. Dusk never liked propaganda, but he concedes that in this case helping the workers understand that they can support one another through unions is important."

TBK_power_unions:0 "Death of Nationalism"
TBK_power_unions_desc:0 "For years many citizens of our nation have considered themselves loyal to Zarantia, even going so far as to refuse to fight against them. Times are changing now and the future we are working towards is brighter than that which any desert queen could ever hope to offer."

TBK_factory_production_councils:0 "Oust the Owners"
TBK_factory_production_councils_desc:0 "The cruel overseers of the former "Labourers" have had their say over the industrial sector for too long! Dusk has proposed that these individuals be removed and replaced with a council comprised of more humble workers in order to streamline production."

TBK_wealth_equalization:0 "Land of the Equals"
TBK_wealth_equalization_desc:0 "If we are to be remembered for one thing then it must be this: Our citizens are treated equally. There will be none who feel as if their lot in life is unfair or unjust, for this land is that of the workers. After all, Wallnut himself said: "I want everyone to celebrate, not just my friends!""

TBK_workers_self_management:0 "Self-Managed Production"
TBK_workers_self_management_desc:0 "The time has come to extend the authority of the local worker councils. They will recieve an expanded authority over legal and industrial processes, making them an integral part of our federal system. The workers shall finally control the means of production in full!"

TBK_land_electrification:0 "Shining Lights"
TBK_land_electrification_desc:0 "The electrification of our roads and cities is a logical next step for our industrial efforts. Infrastructure is the key to any great societal advancement and so we shall ensure ours is prepared for generations of future industrial and technological progress!"

TBK_modern_amenities:0 "The Broadcasting Union"
TBK_modern_amenities_desc:0 "It was not particularly difficult to convince the few media broadcoasting companies that operate in the nation to combine their efforts as part of a new union. Wallnut especially appreciates the sentiment to improve the quality of aired and printed material alongside the benefits for socialist education."

TBK_communal_housing:0 "Communal Standards"
TBK_communal_housing_desc:0 "Communal estates or 'union housing' will provide our few unfortunate citizens with the basic living standards that they need to survive should all else inexplicably be lost. Indeed, as they provide an environment where certain facilities are shared, Dusk Wane speculates that they may even help the reisdents develop a communal identity."

TBK_labour_federalism:0 "Essay On Labour-Federalism"
TBK_labour_federalism_desc:0 "An excerpt from the paper puts it best, 'Socialism and progress are in the hooves of the workers; a federation of workers with equal rights, both poisitve and negative, is the best possible state structure in which that progress can be achieved. I am beholden to the workers as much as they are to one another.'"

TBK_labour_consitution:0 "Federal Bill of Rights"
TBK_labour_consitution_desc:0 "The Federal Bill of Rights is not unlike other such legal documentation with regard to its general concept as a garantor of individual rights and liberties. It is nevertheless different, enshrining additional rights like the right to protest and the right to work which many other 'progessive' state refuse to implement."

TBK_right_to_unionize:0 "Rights of Unions"
TBK_right_to_unionize_desc:0 "Such a fundamental part of our society and state cannot be exclusive or limited to the established unions, the right to unionise for any reason and for all individuals should be guaranteed and enshrined. With the blessing of Wallnut, Dusk Wane should have no issues passing this integral piece of legislations."

TBK_wealth_of_land:0 "Plow the Land"
TBK_wealth_of_land_desc:0 "State investments in the agricultural industries are a logical next step in our industrial development. More food means more surplus, which can give us some extra to export or provide a greater ceiling for potential population growth in the near future."

TBK_rural_industries:0 "Outback Factories"
TBK_rural_industries_desc:0 "Wallnut has been convinced that small factory districts for local communities are efficient and desirable for the general public so that they don't have to make long journies into more traditionally developed parts of the country to contribute to the economic growth and idustrial boom of the nation."

TBK_farming_mechanization:0 "Tractor Collectives"
TBK_farming_mechanization_desc:0 "Wallnut has been convinced that large agricultural collectives are to be established to better destribute the machines and land between workers. This collectivisation should ensure equal oppotunity for all argicultural workers whilst retaining a more effient use of undivided land."

TBK_dusk_factories:0 "To Feed the Workers"
TBK_dusk_factories_desc:0 "A hungry worker is an unhappy worker, as any hungry citizen is an unhappy citizen.

TBK_union_militias:0 "Union Militia"
TBK_union_militias_desc:0 "As of yet, unions that take the form of militia organisations are somewhat of a legal grey zone with their regards to jurisdiction and where the use of force is considered appropriate. We shall legalise and regulate the process of militia creation on the condition that they are beholden to the army in times of war."

TBK_elected_commanders:0 "Elected Commanders"
TBK_elected_commanders_desc:0 "The militia units are well known for the democratic process through which they elect their own leaders. This is yet another grey area which we shall codify as common and accepted practice, following the condition that in times of war the army is responsible organising these leaders and their forces."

TBK_work_dusk:0 "Union of Wallnut and Dusk"
TBK_work_dusk_desc:0 "After slow and careful consideration from our beloved Wallnut, Dusk Wane has convinced him that the logical course of action now is to bring him into his faction proper. To commemorate, Dusk has promised a party in the capital which even he shall attend, but more importantly he has ordered the media into overdrive in support of this move."

TBK_technological_industries:0 "Modern Industrial Productions"
TBK_technological_industries_desc:0 "Technological progress under socialism is, in theory at least, utterly limitless. This is a fundamental tenet of our philosophy and so we will further the development of our lacking industrial equipment through imports, research funding and diligent work from scientists in order to further increase production."

TBK_electronics_industries:0 "Electronics Experiments"
TBK_electronics_industries_desc:0 "It seems there is more to the field of electronics than we first thought. With a dedicated research committee these machines may become our most valuable technological advancement, perhaps even leading the way to greater things than we can possibly imagine."

TBK_chemical_industries:0 "Synthetic Fuel"
TBK_chemical_industries_desc:0 "Whilst we are not necessarily opposed to trade with other nations, in the event of open war a home supply of oil and rubber may prove vital for our war machine.

TBK_niftyn_start:0 "Legacy of Steel Stallion"
TBK_niftyn_start_desc:0 "With the defeat of Chiropterra, Tobuck has become more than just another minor state in Zebrica. The work is far from done, however. Having convinced Wallnut to adopt a communist government, Niftyn must now create a vanguard to lead the newly formed United Lands of Northern Zebrica."

TBK_industrial_ministry:0 "Ministry of Industrial Production"
TBK_industrial_ministry_desc:0 "For a worker's paradise to be achieved it is imperative that we create the means within the state to enable them in their quest to enlarge the means of production and to advance it. With Wallnut's approval, Niftyn has formally established the Ministry of Industrial Production with which he will guide the workers to greatness."

TBK_workers_state:0 "State of Workers and Peasants"
TBK_workers_state_desc:0 "The federation is comprised almost entirely of workers and peasants. It is their nation, their land and their pride and the future which they are all striving to create.

TBK_purge_parasites:0 "Values of Class Struggle"

TBK_estate_collectivization:0 "Estate Collectivization"
TBK_estate_collectivization_desc:0 "Large holdings of land, be they personal or for business, are to be siezed and redistributed to the citizens of our great state at once. Wallnut is in agreement that, if all should own a large amount of land, then all shall celebrate together in joy."

TBK_ponytariat_ownership:0 "Ownership of the Ponytariat"
TBK_ponytariat_ownership_desc:0 "It is a fundamental tenet of the revolution that land should be given to the citizens of any communist state. Not only shall we put this into legal effect, but we shall additionally establish an economic comission to ensure that sectors of the economy cooperate for mutual benefit."

TBK_state_industrial_control:0 "Central Economic Directive"
TBK_state_industrial_control_desc:0 "The Federal Planning Commission has occasionally encountered difficulties when zoning areas for industrialisation thanks to other laws regarding the protection of certain land and buildings. We shall grant them greater powers to ensure that their work remains unhampered."

TBK_tobuck_arms_industries:0 "War-Economy Directive"
TBK_tobuck_arms_industries_desc:0 "To the delight of the Generalissimo, Niftyn has proposed a large expansion of military production to ensure that the state does not fall behind its neighbours in production capacity or stockpiles. The reactionaries shall not outgun us!"

TBK_artillery_production_bonus:0 "Red Star Artillery"
TBK_artillery_production_bonus_desc:0 "The affectionate title of 'Red Stars' originates from war stories that emerged after the victory against Chiropterra. In such low supply of ammunition, artillery was occasionally known to fire masses of flares into the sky or directly at the advancing enemy to stall for time. Though the story is indeed inspiring, perhaps it would be best to update and properly stock our artillery stores for future conflicts."

TBK_infantry_weapon_production_bonus:0 "New Model Battlerifle"
TBK_infantry_weapon_production_bonus_desc:0 "Now that we are in a position to fund and improve on our previous designs, it has become apparent that our current stores of weapons are both old and worryingly diverse. Wallnut needed no convincing that a new and standardized weapon for the troops was necessary and Niftyn is happy to oblige."

TBK_niftyn_factories:0 "To Arm the Revolution"
TBK_niftyn_factories_desc:0 "In the unlikely event that our professional forces are overrun and defeated, it is the duty of the workers and peasants to pick up the slack. We will procure weapons for and train units of worker militia should they be needed in coming conflicts."

TBK_resource_aquisition:0 "Ministry of Industrial Resources"
TBK_resource_aquisition_desc:0 "With the threat of blockades and a significant risk of reactionary trade warfare, it is only logical that a ministry be established to ensure that resources can always be provided for our heavy industry. Needless to say, Wallnut has accepted Niftyn's proposal to assist war production with open hooves"

TBK_expand_steel_production:0 "Increase Steel Quotas"
TBK_expand_steel_production_desc:0 "Steel is perhaps the most important resource for the continued development of our burgeoning industry. For that reason, production quotas will be increased for the most efficient plants and said plants will recieve funding in order to expand their operations."

TBK_manerba_aluminium:0 "Manerba Bauxite Mines"
TBK_manerba_aluminium_desc:0 "Manerba has an impressive supply of aluminium that remains yet untapped in spite of the sizable mining operation there. With some funding and a little additional equipment the workers will begin extracting yet more of our vast wealth of resources."

TBK_rapid_urbanization:0 "Ministry of Urban Development"
TBK_rapid_urbanization_desc:0 "In the modern era it is no surprise that modernising cities is a priority, but it has also become a very messy task thanks to the complexity of urban sprawl. To rectify this issue, Wallnut has signed off on Niftyn's proposal for a Ministry of Urban Development."

TBK_urban_fortifications:0 "Bunker and Shelters Directive"
TBK_urban_fortifications_desc:0 "With the introduction of aircraft into warfare, it is inevitable that bombers will try to reach our cities and tear them down. Though integrating an air defense network is impractical at this time, we can ensure that all future constructions made with hardier materials and that every building has a bunker."

TBK_federal_militia:0 "Federal Reserves"
TBK_federal_militia_desc:0 "These valiant workers and peasants are to be commended for their commitment to revolutionary ideals as part of their militia units. Unfortunately, militia organisations are notoriously unwieldy and may potentially represent a threat to both the state of the army; federal integration is the logical solution."

TBK_socialist_education:0 "Learn, Learn and Learn"
TBK_socialist_education_desc:0 "Wallnut has approved Niftyn's motion to begin an immense literacy campaign for the benefit of all. They must be able to lead themselves as we lead them now, for the revolution and for communism itself."

TBK_manual_lessons:0 "Hooves-On Education"
TBK_manual_lessons_desc:0 "There's nothing quite like a true hooves-on experience when it comes to industry and practical education. If we wish to train a new generation of workers and communists in the true trades of our state and ideology then it must be done properly."

TBK_military_education:0 "Lessons On War"
TBK_military_education_desc:0 "Though slightly hesistant at first, Wallnut has signed off on an extension and restructuring of the school curriculum to account for certain lessons in war and combat in order to better prepare the new generations for potential future conflicts."

TBK_marks_institute:0 "Caramel Marks Institute"
TBK_marks_institute_desc:0 "Though we have done much for the education system of the federation, the high achievers have thus far recieved little attention.

TBK_hazrumenia_communist_party:0 "Communist Party of Hazrumenia"
TBK_hazrumenia_communist_party_desc:0 "Though our faction by now already has incredible influence in the administration, it would be best to formalise this power for the sake of keeping up appearances. Soon Niftyn shall announce the creation of the Communist Party Harzuremia, a party for every worker and peasant."

TBK_soviets_model:0 "Lessons of the Winter Revolution"
TBK_soviets_model_desc:0 "Centralisation of power is necessary for unity and efficiency within our worker's paradise.

TBK_communist_secret_police:0 "State Security Council"
TBK_communist_secret_police_desc:0 "Those that seek to extinguish the flame of the revolution both internal and external deserve no quarter.

TBK_state_mass_media:0 "The Truth"
TBK_state_mass_media_desc:0 "Mass media has long been an effective tool in swaying the population and with the introduction of radio it is now more accessible than ever. Niftyn has set about the creation of a national broadcast station and paper that will provide the workers and peasants with everything that they need to know."

TBK_expand_party_membership:0 "Join the Struggle, Worker!"
TBK_expand_party_membership_desc:0 "Unity through the masses may initially seem counterintuitive, but the reality is that those we invite to the party will support it by default and Niftyn by extention. A recruitment drive is just what we need to ensure that divisions in the administration never even form in the first place."

TBK_orthodox_stallionism:0 "Orthodox Marksist-Stallionism"
TBK_orthodox_stallionism_desc:0 "Niftyn is a dedicated student of Marks and Steel Stallion.

TBK_first_hazrumenian_conference:0 "1st Party Conference of HCP"
TBK_first_hazrumenian_conference_desc:0 "Publicity has always been the ally of the revolution, with Niftyn taking extra care to ensure that he and Wallnut as its canguard make the most use of it.

TBK_new_style_tobuck:0 "Metropolis of the Ponytariat"
TBK_new_style_tobuck_desc:0 "Tobuck has by now long been considered the centre for industrial and urban developments without our great state and the time has come to make the final steps towards the metropolis that all know it could become. It shall serve as a model for other cities within our federation as the beating heart of communism."

TBK_wallnut_stallionist:0 "The Steel Generalissimo"
TBK_wallnut_stallionist_desc:0 "Wallnut has done many great things for communsism and for the creation of the federation. Niftyn and the party have seen fit to bestow the title of 'Steel Generalissimo' upon him to honour his service and commmitment to the revolution; he has of course accepted with immense gratitude and with the intent to celebreate."

TBK_stalliongrad_south:0 "Stalliongrad of Zebrica"
TBK_stalliongrad_south_desc:0 "We are the home of the revolution in Zebrica and so we shall adopt a policy of ideological vanguardism on the continent. There are none that can hold such a magnificent and well-earned title as this and none that can take on the responsibilities that such an important position entails."

TBK_party_hq:0 "Headquarters of the Revolution"
TBK_party_hq_desc:0 "It is a great honour to die for one's ideal of communism. A propaganda wave centering on the enemies of that very ideal as a justification for coming conflicts will work wonders for the population's attitudes towards a large-scale war to be waged against the reactionaries."

TBK_control_militia:0 "Militia Comissars"
TBK_control_militia_desc:0 "It is finally time to remove the remaining semblances of independence that were granted to the militia divisions. Comissars will be assigned to their units and they will serve just the same as any other professional division, though they will of course remain portrayed as public militia for the sake of recruitment."

TBK_marksist_state:0 "Marksist-Stallionist Constitution"
TBK_marksist_state_desc:0 "It is finally time to draft a completed consistution for our worker's paradise.

TBK_work_niftyn:0 "Party of Wallnut and Niftyn"
TBK_work_niftyn_desc:0 "After a significant amount of time spent in discussion, Niftyn has managed to convince Wallnut to officially join the communist party.

TBK_dusk_niftyn_meeting:0 "Socialist Hazrumenia"
TBK_dusk_niftyn_meeting_desc:0 "The time has come to solidify influence and codify ideals once and for all within the political factions of this great socialist state. The battle for the socialist dream is finally over."

TBK_wallnut_communist_diplomacy_desc:0 "As the percieved leader and vanguard of the revolution, it is Wallnut's job to make all declarations regarding war and coming conflicts.

TBK_territory_warzena:0 "Shatter the Crown of Warzah"
TBK_territory_warzena_desc:0 "The gormless monarchists of Warzena believe that their 'reforms' will save their decadent society from collapse; oh how wrong they are. We shall greatly speed up this process by tearing it down and rebuilding it ourselves."

TBK_drive_out_nobles:0 "End the Leopard Line"
TBK_drive_out_nobles_desc:0 "There remains another remnant of the Warzenan monarchy besides the previously ruling king. The Leopard dynasty is scattered and comparatively unimportant, but not powerless; it is imperative that we deal with them before the remnants of the monarchists flock to the old rulers of Warzena."

TBK_spread_collectivization:0 "Fresh Rural Collectives"
TBK_spread_collectivization_desc:0 "With the implementation of actual reforms in Warzena such as the proliferation of new rural collectives in the region, the zebras there will be far more agreeable once we have shown them the errors of their ways. This will no doubt speed up the integration of the region greatly."

TBK_communist_core_warzena:0 "Federal District of Mayrzim"
TBK_communist_core_warzena_desc:0 "A lot can be done with a little renaming and a lot of administrative restructuring; namely the complete incorporation of a once monarchist state into a socialist one.

TBK_internationale_connections:0 "The Global Struggle"

TBK_home_of_revolution:0 "Home of the Revolution"
TBK_home_of_revolution_desc:0 "Truly we are what Stalliongard has not yet become after the passing of our ideological forefathers, a global stage upon which the revolution may be touted and given out freely. The decadent world shall tremble when faced with the might of the federation!"

TBK_assess_hippogriffia:0 "Assess Hippogriffia"
TBK_assess_hippogriffia_desc:0 "The hippogriffs represent perhaps the greatest threat to our great paradise. Their island is defensible, their military prowess renowned and their fighters feared; but they shall not best our revolution this day."

TBK_red_zumidia:0 "Red Zumidia"
TBK_red_zumidia_desc:0 "Zumidia is an integral component in reaching our natural borders and thus it shall be an integral part of the federation. None shall oppose our liberation of the workers that have languished for so long under hippogriffian tyrrany."

TBK_international_war:0 "Hazrumenian Liberation Front"

TBK_revolutionary_spearhead:0 "Revolutionary Spearhead"
TBK_revolutionary_spearhead_desc:0 "Armour is not simply a useful propaganda tool, but also an effective component of a modern fighting force. We can give the divisions in which they are used both a name and a true purpose in the revolution!"

TBK_territory_zarantia:0 "Scatter the Tribes"
TBK_territory_zarantia_desc:0 "The time has come to deal with the tribes that once shunned us, kicking Tobuck to the wayside in order to avoid the wrath of the Storm King all those years ago. The federation does not forget their treason, nor does it intend to allow Zarantia to persist."

TBK_end_sedentary_life:0 "Enforce Sedentary Life"
TBK_end_sedentary_life_desc:0 "Nomads are incredibly difficult to sway for a number of reasons, chief among them is that their society has no concept of a national identity or unifying ideology. If we wish to make progress with them, then we must settle them first."

TBK_end_old_hierarchies:0 "Abolish the Aguellid"
TBK_end_old_hierarchies_desc:0 "The tribal title of Aguellid no longer holds any meaning or relevance to our great nation. We shall abolish it to make way for more appropriate positions in government and the administratitive restructuring of the region."

TBK_guerilla_army_desc:0 "If the warlord era has proven anything, it's that traditional warfare is not the future in armed conflicts.

TBK_special_forces_focus:0 "Wallnut's Finest"

TBK_armour_investment_desc:0 "The Chiropterrans didn't do a lot of things right, but war was one thing at which they were horribly efficient. Reclaiming and developing upon their designs will provide us with valuable theory on the use of armour as well as a potential production model."

TBK_king_protector_desc:0 "As a Warzenan royal, our lord is duty and bloodline bound to protect the ponies of Tobuck as his ancestors have time and time again throughout history; those who seek to encroach on their rightful land shall be expelled.

TBK_tobuck_custodianship:0 "The Custodianship"
TBK_tobuck_custodianship_desc:0 "Custodian of Tobuck is a medieval title which was adopted by previous rulers of Warzena that lorded over the majority-pony region. Our lord, as the ruler of the area in the modern era, will adopt this title to further cement his legitimacy."

TBK_meet_legion_commanders_desc: "A clique of Moonspeakers have come to Alesia with an interesting offer indeed: they want to help Alesia consolidate her rule over once-mighty Chiropterra, on one condition. She is to meet with Lady Commander Lunar Hail, to discuss her destiny."

TBK_declare_faith: "One With the Nightmare"
TBK_declare_faith_desc: ""Nightmare Moon was an autocrat who ruled with an iron hoof and never let anypony deny her her due. Goddess or not, she is an inspiration as a leader. Emulating her example, embracing the faith of my family: if that is the price of securing my rule, I will gladly pay it. Truly, it is no price at all."\n-From the journal of Alesia Snezhnaya."

TBK_adopt_monarch_role: "One With the Duty"
TBK_adopt_monarch_role_desc: ""I have searched far and wide for a suitable claimant to the Severyan throne, and found nothing but layabouts, decadents, and wastrels. While my own relation to the line of tsars is only distant, I have the most important claim of all: I have the sword, and the will to use it."\n-From the journal of Alesia Snezhnaya."

TBK_contact_exiles_again: "Share the News"
TBK_contact_exiles_again_desc: "Much has changed since the last time Alesia contacted the white exiles: the true Severyanians have won a stunning triumph, and are building an army fit to conquer a continent. Alesia will share the good news with the other exiles, inviting them to come and forge a new Severyan empire out of the sands of Zebrica, and one day retake our homeland from the red scum."

TBK_council_batsby: "Council of Batsby"
TBK_council_batsby_desc: "Despite their faith in the Nightmare being the defining characteristic of their civilization, the Chiropterrans are extremely disciplined in all aspects of life other than religion. Other than the centrality of Nightmare Moon, they seem to have no unity on matters of faith. This cannot do. We will call together the Moonspeakers to codify, once and for all, what our faith is. The Tsaritsa commands it."

TBK_ensure_orthodoxy: "Enforce Orthodoxy"
TBK_ensure_orthodoxy_desc: "Now that we have codified our faith, we must ensure the Moonspeakers follow it to the letter and teach it to the masses. We shall let Lunar Hail decide what to do with the intransigent and the heretical."

TBK_no_forgivness: "Of the Pure Faith"

TBK_faith_reeducation: "Offer Them Salvation"
TBK_faith_reeducation_desc: "There are many within our territories who are loyal to the Tsaritsa, but do not know the Nightmare.

TBK_enshrine_missionary_work: "Proselytize To All"
TBK_enshrine_missionary_work_desc: "Our enthusiastic youth must be encouraged to go abroad, to spread the true word of the Nightmare to the lands of the faithless. They will return with their faith strengthened, with a renewed revulsion towards the infidel who rejected their Truth, and if we are lucky with new converts."

TBK_conclave: "Holy Conclave"
TBK_conclave_desc: "The Moonspeakers have up until this point had no real hierarchy except for the first-among-equals position of Chief Moonspeaker. We must organize them into a holy conclave, comprised of twelve Moonspeakers selected by their peers as the most knowledgeable and devout, to head the increasingly-powerful Lunar Church and make decisions on matters of faith."

TBK_head_moonspeaker: "Primate of Moon"
TBK_head_moonspeaker_desc: "The Conclave needs a true head of religion. We will have the Conclave select a Primate of Moon to act as undisputed head of religion, with Alesia herself contributing to the voting as well."

TBK_realm_tsaritsa_temple_desc: "Chiropterra's temples are mostly in secluded places, shrines where creatures can contemplate the Nightmare in silence and darkness, either alone or with a small group. This will not do. We shall construct a great cathedral of glass and steel to awe the world and host grand ceremonies."

TBK_venerate_predecessors: "Venerate Our Ancestors"
TBK_venerate_predecessors_desc: "One aspect of Severyanian folk religion which Tsaritsa Alesia's family incorporated into their Nightmarism was offering prayers and devotion to their departed ancestors. No longer shall the ancient legionnaires be remembered solely as heroes and legends, but as revered ancestors."

TBK_universal_family: "One Family"
TBK_universal_family_desc: "In a way, the people of Novaya Severyana are all Tsaritsa Alesia's children, and are all brothers and sisters under the watchful gaze of the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare.

TBK_duties_to_moon: "Every Faithful's Duty"
TBK_duties_to_moon_desc: "One does not have to be in the military to serve the Tsaritsa.

TBK_communion_nightmare: "Communion To Nightmare"
TBK_communion_nightmare_desc: "Worship of the Nightmare, her hooves touching this world or her gaze watching us from afar, should be conducted with the sanctity that she deserves. Our Goddess will be proud of us, no matter the form she takes."

TBK_eternal_duty: "Eternal Oath"
TBK_eternal_duty_desc: "We shall consult with Lunar Hail to begin crafting the new Legionnaire's Oath, carefully worded to act as both a binding vow of loyalty and a profession of faith. Until we are ready to integrate the old Legions fully, we will begin by demanding this oath from the officers of the Druzhina and the other Tobuckian units, to bind them spiritually to their Tsaritsa."

TBK_jingoism: "Jingoism"
TBK_jingoism_desc: "As an ancient Tsar once said, "Severyana has two friends: the army and the navy." Never has that been more true than today in Novaya Severyana, and like in Chiropterra and old Severyana before us, we will make the army the most important institution of the state, second only to the will of the Tsaritsa herself."

TBK_enshrine_militarism: "The Call of Duty"
TBK_enshrine_militarism_desc: "All must do their part in defence of their country. We will enshrine military service as the highest calling for our subjects, and start a wave of propaganda to drive up enlistment."

TBK_virtue_chivalry: "Virtue of Chivalry"
TBK_virtue_chivalry_desc: "The Druzhina of old Severyana never saw their military service as merely a grim duty to the state, or as just another job. For them, it was a calling, a way to both develop and show their chivalric virtues. We will cultivate this heroic ethos among our soldiers, so that each one of them will welcome the day of battle with joy and celebration."

TBK_druzhina_reform: "Most Noble Druzhina"
TBK_druzhina_reform_desc: "Though the importance of the Druzhina as a part of the military cannot be understated, they have garnered a kind of public respect that makes them perfect for a formal role as police during peacetime. Their leadership will integrate and take over the role of Chiropterran auxileries in order to create a force of the size required to police our great nation."

TBK_reinstate_legions: "The Second Founding"
TBK_reinstate_legions_desc: "After their defeat, the Imperial Legions have existed under a cloud of shame. But our victory was the will of The Nightmare, and will result in greater glories than ever before. We shall formally refound the legions, removing the shame of defeat and affirming their eternal loyalty to Empress, country, and Tsaritsa!"

TBK_millenia_experience: "Millenia of Wars"

TBK_youth_thoughts_desc: "In addition to their experience, the Chiropterrans had among their ranks some of the world's most innovative generals. We should promote these forward-thinkers to our high command so that they can guide us into a new generation of warfare."

TBK_new_imperial_army: "The Second Imperial Army"
TBK_new_imperial_army_desc: "Rejoice! The Imperial Army has been restored, stronger and more faithful than ever. With the Nightmare's blessing and the Tsaritsa's guidance, we cannot fail!"

This oath shall bind me until my death, and my service shall be my reward."\n-From the Oath of the Novaya Severyanian Legionnaire"

TBK_sovereign_mother: "Our Sovereign Mother"
TBK_sovereign_mother_desc: "Alesia is, beyond the head of state, the mother of our people. As any mother would, she knows what is best for her children and for her country. We place our faith in her as her loyal subjects and faithful servants as she continues to foster our young nation."

TBK_fanatical_charge: "Nightmare's With Us!"
TBK_fanatical_charge_desc: "If the faithful should find themselves outnumbered and cut off, they will still have their faith. That faith will send them charging forth, either to the other side of the enemy's lines or into The Nightmare's embrace."

TBK_military_innovations: "Much Needed Upgrades"
TBK_military_innovations_desc: "Our soldiers need far better weapons than they have used thus far. For that, we must make the massive military-scientific base of Chiropterra into the core of our research apparatus, rather than the paltry facilities available in Tobuck."

TBK_infantry_primacy: "Tools of Infantrymare"
TBK_infantry_primacy_desc: "The infantry will always be the backbone of the Imperial Army. We should focus our efforts on providing them the finest equipment, so that they will never fail in their duties to Nightmare and Tsaritsa."

TBK_tank_plane_desigs: "Severyan Innovators"
TBK_tank_plane_desigs_desc: "Heretical as they are, the blasted communists are years ahead of us in tank and aircraft design. Some of the White Exiles who have recently arrived claim to have "acquired" certain blueprints of the latest Severyan designs. We should fund their proposals to build our own variants of these war machines."

TBK_pardon_lmrd: "Imperial Curative Sciences Faculty"
TBK_pardon_lmrd_desc: "The LMRD was a ghastly organization, but that was because they lacked the Tsaritsa's guidance and spent their time on mad side-projects. By adopting a more pragmatic, results-oriented approach, the new Imperial Curative Sciences Faculty can redeem these astray scientists by having them research projects of genuine use to the Tsaritsa."

TBK_realm_expansion_plan: "Natural Borders"
TBK_realm_expansion_plan_desc: "The Chiropterran expansion plans were flawed, but only because of their lack of the Tsaritsa's guidance, rather than their intent. We will prepare a series of conquests to bring our neighbours into the fold, bringing much needed order to this chaotic land."

TBK_warzena_integration: "Protectorate of Zamivgazal"
TBK_warzena_integration_desc: "We will establish a new protectorate in Warzena, named the Protectorate of Zamivgazal, to integrate these lands into our structure of governance. Warzenans who prove themselves loyal and adapt to the Novaya Severyanian ethos will form the basis for a new nobility in the Protectorate."

TBK_reopen_river_trade: "Flow of Trade"
TBK_reopen_river_trade_desc: "Once, there was rich trade along the rivers of Warzena, but the loss of Tobuck and the diplomatic crisis with Zarantia dried up that trade. Now under the Tsaritsa's watchful eye, trade can once again flow along these rivers, with the addition of Chiropterran goods which they once witheld from the locals."

TBK_hippogriffian_zebralands: "Drive Them to Sea"
TBK_hippogriffian_zebralands_desc: "There can be only one great power in these lands, and so long as the Hippogriffs have a clawhold on the mainland our dominance will never be assured. The task ahead seems daunting, but with the Tsaritsa's guidance and the Nightmare's blessing, we cannot fail!"

TBK_add_to_vassal_control: "Award Zirta"
TBK_add_to_vassal_control_desc: "Out of the districts of Zumidia, Zirta is proving the easiest to administer due to its relatively rural, conservative population and its close proximity to our previous conquests. We will name it the County of Zirta, and award it to a loyal vassal."

TBK_caravan_priviliges: "Imperial Caravan Trust"
TBK_caravan_priviliges_desc: "We will grant trans-Zebharan trading privileges to select loyal merchants. With the infrastructure of our Realm supporting them, soon they will bring back great wealth to our nation."

TBK_invasion_ports: "The Grand Dockyards"
TBK_invasion_ports_desc: "In order to properly compete with the hippogriffs, we must dramatically expand our dockyards and  commission a vast fleet of innovative new vessels. Soon they will no longer be the sole power in North Zebrican waters..."

TBK_battleship_ponymkin: "Battleship Ponymkin"
TBK_battleship_ponymkin_desc: "The Tsaritsa has approved the secret construction of the largest, most powerful battleship the world has ever seen: the Battleship Ponymkin. Soon all will stand in awe at our might."

TBK_long_range_submarines_desc: "We have commissioned a new fleet of twelve top-of-the-line submarines to harass and drain the trade routes of our enemies."

TBK_zarantia_integration: "Shizra Confederation"
TBK_zarantia_integration_desc: "The Zarantians are known as an ungovernable people, but that is not so. Their confederal model can be coopted with a few promises and a few bribes to the right zebras, so long as we do not expect them to show more loyalty than simply paying their admittedly-low taxes and fighting in our armies."

TBK_zebra_cossacks: "Imperial Yasani"
TBK_zebra_cossacks_desc: "Zarantians have a strong mercenary tradition and a long history of nomadism. By recruiting select Zarantian tribes to serve as mobile border patrol units, affording them extra pay and the right to wear distinctive culturally-inspired uniforms, we can get a rapid-response force capable of bringing the most distnt frontiers off our realm to heel."

TBK_nationalism: "Fidelity"
TBK_nationalism_desc: "Every subject of our realm must be true to their Tsaritsa, to their homeland, and to its traditions. It is only through a strict Fidelity to these things that a nation remains strong and free of decadence."

TBK_old_chiropterran_governance: "Territories of Old Order"
TBK_old_chiropterran_governance_desc: "Chiropterra is a proud and mighty land, with its own traditions of governance built up over a millennium of struggle and sacrifice. We will integrate it into our tsardom as the Realm of Chiropterra, and while there is much to be done to smooth out the contradictions in Chiropterra, we shall endeavour to leave as much of that venerable state intact as possible."

TBK_remnants_tobuck_government: "Ruins of Late Republic"
TBK_remnants_tobuck_government_desc: "The Republic of Tobuck was a wretched place, and not only because it was a republic. But against all odds, its denizens pulled through and won what was supposed to be an impossible victory. We will integrate them into our tsardom as the Grand Duchy of Tobuck, forever honoured as the people who delivered our Tsaritsa to her throne."

TBK_tsarist_order: "Her Imperial Sovereign's Lands"
TBK_tsarist_order_desc: "The Tsaritsa's rule extends not only to the people of Novaya Severyana, but to the soil as well. We will not collectivize as the red scum do, nor guarantee private property as the snivelling Harmonists do. All land in the Grand Duchy of Tobuck and the Realm of Chiropterra shall be legally owned by Tsaritsa Alesia, to be held and used by her assent."

TBK_tsaritsas_hoof: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof"
TBK_tsaritsas_hoof_desc: "The Nightmare's Hoof was one of the finest, if not the finest spy agency in the world. We should find the agents of this noble institution and recruit them back into the fold, so that the enemies of the Tsaritsa will never be able to keep secrets from her."

TBK_military_agents: "On Foreign Mansions"
TBK_military_agents_desc: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof should focus its efforts on foreign intelligence, as the Nightmare's Hoof did before it. This will give us an edge in any future conflicts, whether against our neighbours or against the communist worms occupying Severyana."

TBK_public_purpose: "On Home Streets"
TBK_public_purpose_desc: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof should focus its efforts on domestic surveillance. That way it can function as a powerful tool to root out corruption, dissent, and all other things which would weaken the state and the reign of the Tsaritsa."

TBK_codex_alesia: "Alesia Pravda"
TBK_codex_alesia_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has introduced a new code of laws to rationalize, streamline, and simplify the complex legal codes which have accumulated over the last milennium in Chiropterra, as well as bringing the once-lawless Grand Duchy of Tobuck in line with the standards of law and order of our realm."

TBK_labour_reform: "Issue of Labourers"
TBK_labour_reform_desc: "The Chiropterran Labourers do not fall neatly into our societal structure. Recognising this, the Tsaritsa now deliberates over what is to be done with this misbegotten caste of workers."

TBK_chiropterran_tone: "The New Homeland"
TBK_chiropterran_tone_desc: "Despite our differences, the Tsaritsa has seen it fit to induct members of the Chiropterran elite into her court. Their experience in economic centralism and social engineering on a mass scale make them uniquely qualified for our new administration."

TBK_autocracy: "Autocracy"
TBK_autocracy_desc: "Ultimate temporal authority must be invested in a single ruler, and it is irrevocable save by the decree of the Nightmare Herself. The great pyramid of authority must have a summit, and that summit must be a single autocrat, for a divided state cannot stand."

TBK_severyan_tone: "The Old Severyana"
TBK_severyan_tone_desc: "Thus far the expatriates from Severyana have proven themselves invaluable in the construction of the new administration. It is only fitting that they should be rewarded for their marvellous work and that we should further expand the repatriation program in order to facilitate future expansions of the state."

TBK_social_elements: "Elements of Imperialism"
TBK_social_elements_desc: "While the Equestrian Elements of Harmony are partially responsible for weakening Severyana and leaving it open to communism, the fundamental idea of enumerating a set of virtues as guiding principles for the state is a good one. We will enumerate our own set of "Elements," to act as the moral guides for the Tsaritsa's government."

TBK_element_order: "Element of Order"
TBK_element_order_desc: "The Element of Order refers to the fundamental value in obeying your superiors, following orders, and respecting the hierarchies you live under. It is distinct from the Equestrian Element of Loyalty because it does not orient itself around on personal connections, but around strict duties."

TBK_element_will: "Element of Will"
TBK_element_will_desc: "The Element of Will refers to the virtue to be found in imposing your will upon the world, and therefore lends itself naturally to the captains of industry as well as the high officials of state."

TBK_state_capitalism: "Charter of Corporatives"
TBK_state_capitalism_desc: "Whilst incredibly efficient, the economic model that the Chiropterrans have made extensive use of is not entirely appropriate for the subjects of the Tsaritsa. Much of the state-controlled industry shall be split between existing corporations with the intent to decentralise, if only slightly, the stratocratic methods of our new citizens."

TBK_military_industries_focus: "Arms For the Empire"
TBK_military_industries_focus_desc: "We will continue the Chiropterran policy of manufacturing only such consumer goods as are absolutely necessary. The bulk of our industry shall go towards supplying the legions."

TBK_establish_civilian_sector: "Products For the Subjects"
TBK_establish_civilian_sector_desc: "Our Tobuckian subjects are not used to the austere life the Chiropterran legionnaires lived. Accordingly, we will use some of our industry to manufacture consumer goods for our subjects to keep them happy, well-fed and prosperous."

TBK_element_honour: "Element of Honour"
TBK_element_honour_desc: "The Element of Honour refers to upholding the duties and dignity of one's station with upright zeal. It differs from the Element of Honesty in that the meaning of Honour is heavily dependent on your social station: the Honour of the labourer is to work, while the Honour of the soldier is to fight, and the Honour of the Tsaritsa is to rule."

TBK_crown_scouts: "Organisation of Moon Rangers"
TBK_crown_scouts_desc: "Chiropterran youth are largely left to their own devices, their parents and local youth programs entrusted to instill good values in them. While this worked well when Chiropterra was a thousand year old stratocracy, given recent cultural changes it would be best to centralize these youth programs to ensure they inculcate not only faith in The Nightmare, but also a zealous devotion to the Tsaritsa."

TBK_element_authority: "Element of Authority"
TBK_element_authority_desc: "The Element of Authority refers to the central importance of leaders to recognize their own right to lead, granted by the Tsaritsa, and not to shy away from doing what it takes to maintain proper hierarchy and respect for superiors."

TBK_loyal_education: "Faithful Curriculum"
TBK_loyal_education_desc: "Our school curricula must teach the true history of our tsardom: from the glory of old Severyana, to the fall at the hooves of the sun and the communists, to the parallel exiles of the Nightmare's Legions and the Tsaritsa herself, to the glorious present and the bright future."

TBK_diploma_program: "Imperial Diplomas"
TBK_diploma_program_desc: "We will standardise our higher education program, collecting the qualifications of our realm's best and brightest into a system of imperial diplomas. This will streamline scientific research significantly."

TBK_arch_enemy_communism: "Death To Marksism!"
TBK_arch_enemy_communism_desc: "There was one pony in history more evil than the usurper Celestia. Her name was Caramel Marks. Not only does her doctrine deny the Nightmare's right to rule, it denies monarchy itself and seeks to destroy all the noble traditions of this world. Marksists are anathema, and there is no higher honour than to destroy the red devils."

TBK_severyan_curriculum: "Severyan Language Act"
TBK_severyan_curriculum_desc: "Wer will fund new courses to teach Severyanian in our schools, with those who have completed Severyanian courses given a competitive edge in attaining promotions in the government and military."

TBK_table_nobility_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has ordered a census of the noble families of Chiropterra, such that the accumulated privileges and duties of the last thousand years can be collected, defined, and standardized into a clear ranking scheme."

TBK_traditonal_social_order: "Traditional Social Order"
TBK_traditonal_social_order_desc: "For all the laudable discipline of their military hierarchy, Chiropterran civil society is distressingly egalitarian. Other than a few aristocratic families whose role is mainly honourary, the faithful are largely treated as equals. We must rectify this situation by codifying hereditary social castes with distinct rights and responsibilites, all working for the glory of The Nightmare and the Tsaritsa."

TBK_severyan_culture: "Love Of Severyana"
TBK_severyan_culture_desc: "Severyanian culture was a magnificent thing, blending together elegance and austerity, form and function, bombast and tranquility. That was before the usurper Celestia diluted it and the communist iconoclasts destroyed it. And yet it shall be again: we shall organize festivals and holidays to inculcate in our people a love of Severyana's traditions and beauty."

TBK_severya_primacy: "Severyana Above All!"
TBK_severya_primacy_desc: "Through hard work and careful social engineering, we have brought back Severyanian culture from the brink of extinction. Though the communists would see it slain, we have brought Severyanian traditions back, stronger than ever!"

TBK_spirit_of_alexander_desc: "In honour of our glorious ancestor, we will raise two new "Snezhinskaya" divisions of Druzhina from the former legionnaires of mighty Chiropterra."

TBK_absolute_authority: "Her Will Be Done"
TBK_absolute_authority_desc: "As The Nightmare's chosen, Tsaritsa Alesia rules through divine right. Her word is the law of the land. Her every order shall be understood as the will of the realm, to be followed as unquestioningly as if The Nightmare Herself had willed it."

TBK_ursagrad_capital: "My Snezhnograd"
TBK_ursagrad_capital_desc: "Ursagrad occupies a key position between the Chiropterran Realm and the Grand Duchy of Tobuck, and its history as being founded by the Severyanian Ursa Legion would reinforce that aspect of our Tsardom's character. Many inhabitants even speak an ancient dialect of Severyanian. Tsaritsa Alesia shall make Ursagrad her capital, renamed in honour of her glorious ancestor Alexander Snezhinsky."

TBK_royal_patronage: "Arts Of the Court"
TBK_royal_patronage_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia does not hoard the wealth of the realm as Griffon kings do. She has taken it upon herself to uplift a new generation of patriotic artists with her patronage, so that the splendour of Novaya Severyana may be reflected in works of transcendent beauty."

TBK_royal_example: "Through Her Example"
TBK_royal_example_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has no tolerance for decadence or waste. While her palace shall be grand, its decorations shall be strictly devotional, and she herself shall be clad in an austere uniform at all times. Through her example, our subjects will learn to stay clear of the wastrel's vices."

TBK_court_tsaritsa: "Court of Stars"
TBK_court_tsaritsa_desc: "The Tsaritsa will set up a grand throneroom, where she will hold a magnificent court that one day will beggar even that of the usurper Celestia. Foreign dignitaries and Novaya Severyanian nobles alike will be in awe of the Court of Stars."

TBK_palace_estates: "Tsaritsy Polya"
TBK_palace_estates_desc: "We will develop the fertile lands around our palace as the personal demesne of the Tsaritsa. It will provide for her vast household, as well as covering a significant portion of the expenses of state."

TBK_severyan_customs: "Grand Winter Gala"
TBK_severyan_customs_desc: "The tsars of Old Severyana would host great galas on the longest night of the year. They would invite all the nobles and a few lucky commoners to their palaces, where they would put aside their differences and celebrate the beauty of winter and of the night. We shall revive this tradition, and invite the nobles of Chiropterra to pay homage to the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare."

TBK_safeguard_communities: "Rights of Commoners"
TBK_safeguard_communities_desc: "Communist filth claim that by enforcing a class system we are guaranteeing poverty. Like everything else they say, this is a lie. The commoners shall be cared for, and so long as they fulfill their duties, they need never know hunger."

TBK_priviliges_aristocracy: "Duties of Aristocracy"
TBK_priviliges_aristocracy_desc: "In Griffonia, perhaps, or under the usurper Celestia, the aristocracy are lazy layabouts sucking the bloated corpse of the state. Not in old Severyana, not in Chiropterra, and not in Novaya Severyana. The aristocracy will have important martial duties to fulfill, with the lesser gentry fighting in the Legions and the higher nobles using their wealth to support the army."

TBK_imperial_bureaucracy: "Bureaucracy of the Tsardom"
TBK_imperial_bureaucracy_desc: "We will extend our bureaucracy to govern every portion of our realm, to ensure that all proceeds according to the will of the Nightmare and the command of the Tsaritsa."

TBK_resurrected_severyana_desc: "Against all odds we have not only preserved what we once thought lost in Severyana, but we have revived it in the most glorious fashion. The light of our homeland burns bright, fuelled anew by our revanchism and loyalty to the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare!"

TBK_perfect_synthesis: "Perfect Synthesis"
TBK_perfect_synthesis_desc: "In spite of the great challenges we have faced, there now exists a unqiue and unbreakable bond between Chiropterran and Severyan culture and society. Though there is much left to be done, the Tsaritsa's loyal subjects will never again consider themselves separate; we have achieved an ideal unlike any other."

### Military post-tree

TBK_republic_armed_forces: "Army of the Republic"
TBK_republic_armed_forces_desc: "Tobuck was never really meant to act as a real country but here we are. We have nothing but bodyguards, mercenaries and scared conscripts next to a mish-mash of guns and not always assorted ammunition. Time to make an army out of it. But we'll manage. How hard can it all really be?"

TBK_construct_military_academy: "War College of Tobuck"
TBK_construct_military_academy_desc: "Well. Since we no longer rely on mercenaries and shall we say decentralized forces, we need to learn and teach how to maintain and organize an army. Now. We can't afford to go slow and meticulously build a proud and long-standing officer corp tradition. Time for some crash courses!"

TBK_quality_leadership: "Strength Through Quality"
TBK_quality_leadership_desc: "When in war, you need to learn what your strengths and vulnerabilities are. So while we are not that small of a country, we will be outnumbered. However, by focusing on training a good officer corps, we can make sure that our proficiencies in weaponry are used in the most efficient way possible. No waste of bullets or ponies!"

TBK_additional_manpower: "Fill the Ranks"
TBK_additional_manpower_desc: "When outnumbered, the best bet is to try and even the score. So there are more of them than there are of us but by the transitive properties of us knowing how to get our hooves on a lot of guns and ammos, we should be able to make sure that we kill enough of them so that we can take them! That's math. Who ever said that war was hard?"

TBK_magic_ponies: "War Can Be Magic Too!"
TBK_magic_ponies_desc: "Northern Zebrica is hardly a center of magical knowledge but we do have unicorns. Now granted, very few of them have even shown an inkling towards violence and normally, that would be good. However, we'll need to teach them to go from magical cake making to battlefield shield generation if we want to get an edge in the trenches."

TBK_radio_development: "Radio R&D"
TBK_radio_development_desc: "Our enemies have had years to prepare for an invasion and they'll have a slew of tactics to take us on. So we need to establish clear and excellent lines of communication for our units if we want to be able to adapt quickly and safely! Lucky for us, our smuggler friends know a thing or two about radio and encrypted communications!"

TBK_standard_rifles: "Commission New Battle Rifle"
TBK_standard_rifles_desc: "Now here's a conundrum, how do gun runners arm a standardized army? Well the answer is that it's a nightmare. You need factories, ammo, a supply line and all of it needs to be efficient with a much lower profit margin. But we made our bed and we need modern rifles if we want to kill whoever wants to lay in that bloody bed!"

TBK_new_leaders: "In Service Of the Republic"
TBK_new_leaders_desc: "With the warlords gone, we need to build up the Republican Guard and quickly. But more importantly, we need sane and loyal ponies to lead it. We're going to need to do a whole lot of performance review to find somepony capable in that sorry lot of an army. I mean, we are looking for the best of the best! Which is still a low bar here."

TBK_hire_griffonian_experts: "Hire Griffonian Instructors"
TBK_hire_griffonian_experts_desc: "When it comes to war, you can never go wrong with hiring some Griffonian veterans. That continent has been in turmoil ever since somegriff lost a trinket and Kemerskai broke everything. Some of them must surely be interested in working in a warmer climate for some exceptional pay. Just make sure the other officers don't learn how much."

TBK_establish_national_militia: "Rapid-Response Militia"
TBK_establish_national_militia_desc: "Not mentioning the internal risks to the republic, neither Zarantia, Warzena or Chiropterra can be described as being thrilled with us breathing. With such angry neighbours, we need. Let us set up local teams of minuteponies with some basic training and equipment to hold off the enemy until the army can arrive on the battlefield."

TBK_plan_militia_resistance: "Militia Battle Order X1"
TBK_plan_militia_resistance_desc: "The minuteponies can only do so much and so we need to accept that they'll fold if the army is delayed in any way. So let's work with that knowledge. Rather than sell an idea of fighting to the death to simple citizens, we'll instruct them to disperse before it's too late, disturb enemy movements and support refugees so as to not clog the roads and bridges."

TBK_army_grand_battleplan: "Central Army HQ"
TBK_army_grand_battleplan_desc: "The entire Republic rests upon a single center of command. If Tobuck falls, there is no hope of falling back. Therefore, our entire military doctrine must be to delay, stop and destroy anything that is on its way towards the capital. "

TBK_proper_trenches: "Shovel In Every Hoof"
TBK_proper_trenches_desc: "They say that there are two kinds of ponies: those who dig and those who have a gun. What they forget is that there's a third kind of pony: the one who pays. So you get both a shovel and a gun and if you want to live, you better dig those trenches like there's no tomorrow! We're not running a playground here!"

TBK_special_engineer_training: "Special-Engineer Courses"
TBK_special_engineer_training_desc: "It turns out that simply digging trenches is not as easy as it sounds like. There's a whole art in standardizing them and making them fit for combat, housing and logistical support. We better start selecting a few lucky ponies who will get the prized honor of supervising others doing the digging."

TBK_fortification_program: "Fortress-Republic"
TBK_fortification_program_desc: "Tobuck was never in the spot of defending itself and it shows. We won't be safe without some massive investment into our infrastructure. We need military depots, casemates, forts in any strategic positions and most importantly, the means of moving our troops and equipment around quickly and efficiently."

TBK_killzone_tactics: "Killzone Tactics"
TBK_killzone_tactics_desc: "With our limited supply of soldiers, we will have holes in our lines but we can transform this weakness into a strength by drawing our enemies in less defended open fields where we can blaze them from our stronger positions and then mop them up using our few mobile units."

TBK_masterwork_trenches: "Impenetrable Defence"
TBK_masterwork_trenches_desc: "We have a solid basis but we need to do more if we want to have any chance of withholding a major offensive. Send concrete to the trenches. Plant landmines in the killzones. Improve coordination between the artillery and the field engineers. Make every inch of terrain a Tartarus to go through! The line must hold!"

TBK_army_superior_firepower: "Battlefield Destruction"
TBK_army_superior_firepower_desc: "The Republic was born in a pile of guns surrounded by ponies who knew how to use them. This is where we came from and this will be how we prevail through the worst of storms! More guns. More firepower. And make sure they'll only pry them from our cold dead hooves!"

TBK_introduce_cannons: "Discard the Bombards"
TBK_introduce_cannons_desc: "Too many of our soldiers are still accustomed to old artillery pieces better suited for a museum than for the battlefield. It's partly on us as Pea Shooter ordered the best cannons to be sold internationally. Well, that's over. Soldiers? Forget about blackpowder, smoke and cannonballs. Meet the shell and the howitzer. Ain't they a beauty?"

TBK_anti_armor_aid: "Pierce All Armour"
TBK_anti_armor_aid_desc: "The tank is all the range nowadays. It'll be a long time for us to have the industry to produce them reliably for domestic use. However we can learn how to penetrate them. And if we do, that's where we'll be happy to be a small country. There'll be no going around for them. So let's wreck some armor!"

TBK_endless_steel_rain: "Explosive Forecast"
TBK_endless_steel_rain_desc: "A good cannon can hit a target and kill it. A better cannon will hit multiple targets at once and make sure that they're either dead or unfit for combat. And that my friends is how a small country negates the power of demographics. Hey, you! I hope you brought an umbrella!"

TBK_chemical_deterrence: "Chemical Deterrence"
TBK_chemical_deterrence_desc: "At some point in time, in a wretched place, the very worst of matchmakers had the idea of bringing chemistry and ballistics together. However, in Tobuck, we've learned to make the best out of the worst and we'll be damned if we're not making good use of anything that makes our guns deadlier. Now, carry those barrels with care."

TBK_proud_army: "Proud Foals of \nthe Republic"
TBK_proud_army_desc: "It was a difficult endeavour but we've never been afraid of difficulties. Now, a new generation of ponies is entering the barracks of the Republican Army of Tobuck and what they are finding isn't a slapped-together mess anymore. The era of warlords is well and truly over. Now stands an army, proud and strong!"

TBK_warlords_army: "Warlords of Tobuck"
TBK_warlords_army_desc: "Hey, warlords aren't so bad. Keep 'em paid, keep 'em armed, and they'll fight for anycreature, even a crook like Vasile. Pea's problem was he was a cheapskate who paid them all ad hoc and never signed a decent contract. That won't be an issue for us."

TBK_army_mobile_warfare: "Relentless Pursuit"
TBK_army_mobile_warfare_desc: "A decentralised mercenary force can move as fast as tartarus if given the right incentives. No need for elaborate chains of command, just offer a bonus to the first ones to the fight, and to any lower-level officer who shows daring and initiative. Boom. Instant blitzkrieg."

TBK_increase_military_production: "State Military-Industrial Complex"
TBK_increase_military_production_desc: "We need some proper factories if we're gonna make all this equipment. Yes, it'll be expensive, but absolutely nothing has a higher long-term profit margin than weapons."

TBK_trucks_galore: "Faster Than Anypony"
TBK_trucks_galore_desc: "You know what's faster than a speeding pegasus? A speeding truck. Let's motorize as much of our army as we can. It'll let 'em maneuver faster it'll let 'em carry more gear, and it'll let 'em carry off more loot once the fighting is done. So long as they give us a cut for the truck..."

TBK_add_armour_to_trucks: "Protect the Engines"
TBK_add_armour_to_trucks_desc: "Bullets and gasoline don't mix. Fortunately, we have a lot of scrap metal and a lot of ponies who'd be willing to do some dubiously-safe welding work for a quick buck. Who said making armoured vehicles was hard?"

TBK_get_some_tanks: "Hire the Gryphon Company" 
TBK_get_some_tanks_desc: "There's armoured vehicles, and then there's proper armour. For that, we gotta pay. Fortunately, Vasile has some contacts in Griffonia who have some proper hardware. Let's see if the bats and their fancy training can get through this..."

TBK_raider_trucks: "Leave ´em In Dust!"
TBK_raider_trucks_desc: "Our mercenaries have really taken to these trucks! They've given them names, spraypainted all sorts of things on them, and upgunned them well beyond the bounds of common sense. Firepower, mobility, and a symbol to rally around: what's not to love?"

TBK_army_mass_assault: "Lust For Loot"
TBK_army_mass_assault_desc: "If there's one thing Tobuck has a limitless supply of, it's greed. They've all seen how rich you can get off scavenging and gun-running, so if we give them the cheapest guns we can find and then promise to let them pick their foes (and their friends!) clean, we'll barely have to pay 'em!"

TBK_actual_guns: "Locked and Loaded"
TBK_actual_guns_desc: "So what if Pea Shooter sold most of the Storm King's old guns? Who needs 'em? I heard you can put together a submachine gun out of piping and sheet metal in a backyard welding shop. Oh, fine, we'll also buy some rifles. What is Tobuck coming to that we have to import weapons?"

TBK_abundant_recruits: "Everyone's a Mercenary"
TBK_abundant_recruits_desc: "Can you hold a gun? Would you hold this one? Would you stand over there and shoot anypony who comes near for a few bits? Congrats, you're a mercenary! Who knew recruitment could be so simple?"

TBK_frenzied_horde: "Drugs and Booze For All!"
TBK_frenzied_horde_desc: "You mix some old-fashioned black powder into rum, that's pirate's brew. You mix some smokeless powder and cocaine, that's brown-brown. You drink some pirate's brew and snort some brown-brown, you'll be the most fearless pony alive!"

TBK_glory_to_deluge: "What's Yours Is Mine!"
TBK_glory_to_deluge_desc: "We're declaring open season on the enemy's... everything. The promise of unrestricted plunder will attract more low-lifes and rabble to our army, and nothing's more dangerous than a low-life with a gun and a motive."

TBK_victory_celebrations: "Endless Triumphs"
TBK_victory_celebrations_desc: "Hired guns love being told they've done a good job. We'll festoon them with medals, shower them with booze, and pretty soon our army will have the best morale in Zebrica!"

TBK_bring_abord_new_folk: "The Warzenan  Fellows"
TBK_bring_abord_new_folk_desc: "What's better than a mercenary band willing to work for you? A mercenary band with an infamous leader who's willing to work for you, that's what! This 'Captain Z' might need some time to adjust, but new blood is always welcome!"

TBK_gather_weapons: "Grab All the Guns"
TBK_gather_weapons_desc: "There's more than enough guns still stashed in Tobuck to arm our forces, we just have to find them. Search the houses, order of the president. Search the sewers, the junkyards, search and grab every firearm and every bullet you can find!"

TBK_mercenary_gunsmiths: "Knick-Knack Smiths"
TBK_mercenary_gunsmiths_desc: "Mercenaries love their weapons, and they love personalising and customising them. Some spend so much time on their weapons, they become better gunsmiths than the actual gunsmiths! We should offer these fellows new jobs,away from the front lines, making weapons for their old squadmates."

TBK_capture_machines: "Grab Some Vehicles"
TBK_capture_machines_desc: "We've got cutpurses, we've got congriffs, we've got bandits, and soon enough we'll have carjackers too! We'll send our troops out to "acquire" some vehicles, doesn't matter the condition, and refurbish them into supply trucks and troop transports."

TBK_organised_scavenging: "Organised Scavenging"
TBK_organised_scavenging_desc: "Why make when you can take? We will gather the gunsmithing gurus of the mercenary bands together, and create a set of manuals on how best to scavenge and refurbish captured equipment, whether you got it from the enemy or a scrapheap or your own grandmother."

TBK_mercenaries_command: "All-Mercenaries Command"
TBK_mercenaries_command_desc: "Our troops are enthusiastic, but it takes more than enthusiasm to win wars. We'll have to organize them into a cetnralized command structure if we want to pull of anything but the most rudimentary of operations."

TBK_payment_policy: "Specify Payment"
TBK_payment_policy_desc: "We have a lot of mercenary contracts, and the last thing we want is to accidentally break one of them through carelessness. That's how you get shot. We'll gather together the bookkeepers of the republic's bureaucracy and some of our old money launderers to keep track of all these contracts, making sure our payments are on-time and dependable."

TBK_drive_up_recruitment: "Enlist Now To the Free Forces!"
TBK_drive_up_recruitment_desc: "Why die for patriotism when you can die for money? Okay, that's a bad way of putting it, but it's the core of our sales pitch. Soldiers of more legitimate states struggle to get by and have to follow rigid discipline. In Tobuck, you get all the benefits of going bandit without anycreature calling you a bandit! Not to your face at least."

TBK_hill_warfare: "Hire the Tefe-Band"
TBK_hill_warfare_desc: "Mountain specialists? Well, Tobuck doesn't have many mountains... Ah well, they'll probably be useful for something in the future; let's hire them and get what expertise we can!"

TBK_jungle_warfare: "Hire the Zhevestes"
TBK_jungle_warfare_desc: "Jungle runners will certainly have their uses in the... The very expansive jungles of Tobuck. Hmm. Well, guerrilla warfare experts are always welcome here; let's bring them into our big mercenary family!"

TBK_desert_warfare: "Hire the Zodh Duners"
TBK_desert_warfare_desc: "Now, desert raiders are going to really help us out. Frankly it's incredible that we hadn't hired creatures with skills already, but there's no time like the present to finally plug a hole in our forces' capabilities!"

TBK_gather_shared_experiences: "Shared Tales and Pains"
TBK_gather_shared_experiences_desc: "If there is one thing that can be garnered from pain and suffering, it is how to avoid experiencing it a second time. We can learn a lot from our soldiers and their commanding officers, and so we should if we want to ensure they don't all die to more conventional armies."

TBK_some_equipment_standartisation: "Bring Old Units Up-To-Date"
TBK_some_equipment_standartisation_desc: "Whilst our current guns are good enough, they can be better. Why not figure out how these new weapons work and then make them ourselves, or use their parts to improve our stockpiles? better guns means a cleaner payday after all!"

TBK_rough_scarred: "The Rough and \nScarred Scum"
TBK_rough_scarred_desc: "What we lack in profressionalism we make up for in experience and our soldiers have the scars to prove just how much they've seen and done. Our bands are mighty regiments of battle-hardened soldiers, inspiring fear in their enemies with their brutality and discipline."

### Air Force tree

TBK_air_force_start: "First Air-Platoon"
TBK_air_force_start_desc: "Just because Tobuck was known for having lots of guns doesn't mean that we can't try to do other things with them! If we can find some planes and tape our guns to them, suddenly we'll have a real airforce!"

TBK_air_superiority_focus: "Battles In the Clouds"
TBK_air_superiority_focus_desc: "With our fledgling airforce, it is important that we train our pilots to choose their battles. Prioritize picking off the weaker enemy aircraft and avoiding the line of fire from stronger ones, and not only will they live to see another day, but they'll get better at completing their missions too!"

TBK_ground_support_focus: "Assault From Above"
TBK_ground_support_focus_desc: "Shooting down to the ground is just as important as shooting at other planes. Our future CAS pilots must undergo some additional training in order for their duties to be performed in an acceptable manner."

TBK_cas_planes: "Close-Air Support Designs"
TBK_cas_planes_desc: "Of course, all the training in the world will do no good if there's no plane for our specialized pilots to fly. We've managed to scrounge up some blueprints to a basic support plane. With some study, maybe our engineers can build a better one in the future."

TBK_aquire_more_fighters: "Establish Additional Squadrons"
TBK_aquire_more_fighters_desc: "We haven't the faintest how he managed to hide them for so long, but we found a farmer that was hoarding dozens of basic aircraft that he had built himself inside of his barns. It took a bit of convincing, but we've hired him to help design our future generations of fighters. He even agreed to turn his aircraft over to us to be used for military purposes."

TBK_naval_bombers: "Green Bay Bomber Wing"
TBK_naval_bombers_desc: "Unfortunately for us, one of the things we may have to worry about is having our ports blockaded. Coincidentally, one of our engineers has come up with quite the solution: A new type of bomber designed specifically to destroy ships."

TBK_air_academy: "Air Weapon Tactics"
TBK_air_academy_desc: "What luck! A former "laborer" from Chiropterra has approached us and claimed that she used to be one of the best pilots in Equestria of all places. She's asked for safe passage back to her homeland. [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to do this, but in exchange, she will give some lessons to our pilots."

TBK_bomber_developments: "Bomber Plane Designs"
TBK_bomber_developments_desc: "There's been a new development lately: According to one of our advisors, a huge focus of our neighbors has been on developing better and more devastating bombers. After hearing of this, [FROM.GetLeader] has ordered that we also focus on designing better bombers so that we do not get left behind."

TBK_air_force_final: "Aces of Northern Zebrica"
TBK_air_force_final_desc: "Tobuck! Known for our supply of guns, but also now known for our... still fledgling airforce! We've even begun to attract some aviation experts from other countries. We have come a long way in such a short time, but there's still much more to learn as we continue building a proper airforce. At least our pilots can match the skill of our more developed neighbors."

TBK_air_assembly_line: "State Aircraft Company"
TBK_air_assembly_line_desc: "Surprisingly enough, a fledgling business devoted to aviation has popped up recently. Perhaps with some investment, we could convince them to help maintain our planes. Some of our aircraft have had some trouble holding themselves together mid-flight anyways."

TBK_radar_development: "R.A.D.A.R"
TBK_radar_development_desc: "Radios, communication of the future! And apparently great for getting an idea of what the enemy is up to, as well! Maybe we could get a few of these fancy new towers built around Tobuck if someone bothered to make some blueprints for them."

### Navy Tree

TBK_navy_start: "Piers of Tobuck"
TBK_navy_start_desc: "What do you mean our docks were only meant for trade? That's preposterous, the Storm King had used Tobuck as a weapons depot, it's only sensible that our shipyards be used for war as well."

TBK_cruiser_focus: "Open Maneuver Plans"
TBK_cruiser_focus_desc: "It's especially important in naval warfare to know who is doing what since the stakes are so high at sea. A few classes for our aspiring seafarers should help keep them coordinated so that they can better navigate around and protect one another."

TBK_submarine_focus: "Beneath the Waves"
TBK_submarine_focus_desc: "Shooting your enemy from afar is preferable. Shooting them while they can't see you is better. If our sailors can keep both of these tactics in mind, we will surely come out victorious in any engagement!"

TBK_naval_academy: "Cadet Academy"
TBK_naval_academy_desc: "It has come to our attention that very few of our seafarers actually possess the know-how to properly run a ship. Like it or not, they'll have to sit down and learn a few things if they want to sail the seas."

TBK_ship_dockyard_expansion: "Grand Naval Shipyards"
TBK_ship_dockyard_expansion_desc: "As we build more and more ships, we've begun to attract some of our citizens who hadn't shown any interest in the seas until recently. If we give them a place to work and some lessons to go with it, we'll have some of the finest shipwrights in Zebrica, maybe even the world."

TBK_battleship_designs: "Floating Fortress"
TBK_battleship_designs_desc: "As we make progress towards establishing our navy as a formidable force, the need for capital ships to spearhead them has become increasingly apparent. We don't expect to make many, but it would be an insult to our population if we didn't at least try."

TBK_destroyer_designs: "Small Ship Designs"
TBK_destroyer_designs_desc: "Destroyers! They make up the bulk of most navies, and ours will be no exception. First though, we'll need to actually put together a decent design for one. Somewhat recently, a destroyer from Maregypt had wrecked itself near our coastline. Maybe we can study that."

TBK_submarine_designs: "Submarine Hulls"
TBK_submarine_designs_desc: "Submarines! The silent killers of the sea. They're infamous for the amount of damage they can inflict upon bigger ships. It only makes sense that we should invest in them, seeing as some of our neighbors have larger navies than ours."

TBK_cruiser_design: "Ship Armour"
TBK_cruiser_design_desc: "Land-based airports have their uses, but mobile airports, ones that we can launch air raids from at nearly any location? Those can be incredibly useful. The fact that they can be heavily armored is a huge bonus. We still need to design them, of course."

TBK_navy_final: "Rule the Waves"
TBK_navy_final_desc: "Tobuck! Known for our supply of guns, but also now known for our... still fledgling navy! We've come a long way in such a short time, but there's still more to learn and discover as we become a real player in the sea. At the very least, our sailors can go hoof-to-hoof with the very best from across the world."

### Wallnut events

tobuck_wallnut.1.t:0 "Who's Gonna Help Me?"
tobuck_wallnut.1.d:0 "He had to get rid of one of them, that was the hard part. Making friends was easy and having to dispose of any of them was a hard choice, but it was a choice he had to make.\n\nWallnut, usually never one for files and papers, was sat at a new desk with his hooves up; brow furrowed at the two dossiers in front of him. Baragzen and Alesia, the two exiles. One from another country, the other from another continent. Sure they were monarchists and traditionalists, but he was nothing if not open to even the most disparate creatures. They had all been warlords once, at least they had been able to bond over that.\n\nOf course the difficult decision remained, in spite of his musings. He needed one friend and one enemy to make sure his government kept itself upright, work with one and target the other. The zebra appreciated a good party, but the earth pony was witty and fun to talk to; in different ways they all got on like a house on fire.\n\nWallnut sighed and set down the dossiers with an uncharacteristic malaise about him. Who would he keep around to set against the other?"
tobuck_wallnut.1.a:0 "Alesia could console him afterwards."
tobuck_wallnut.1.b:0 "Baragzen would lift his spirits with festivities."

tobuck_wallnut.2.t:0 "Кто же нам поможет?" ###Garion
tobuck_wallnut.2.d:0 "Был ранний полдень в "Солёном бароне", популярном пабе на побережье Тобука, недалеко от границы с Хироптеррой. Нахождение в такой непосредственной близости от этих фанатиков часто приводило к интересным разговорам о том, что происходило за предупреждающими знаками, предварительно разбросанными вдоль побережья. \n\n— Я слышал, что они приносят зебр в жертву своим ночным богам! — Завопил один жеребец, размахивая пивом, чтобы придать ужаса своему утверждению. \n\nО, да? А я слышала, что они вызывают монстров, чтобы похищать наших детей посреди ночи! — Крикнула ещё одна, вскакивая со стула. \n\nВскоре местные жители быстро впали в истерику и отдались своим страхам, погрязнув в рассказах обо всём ужасном, происходящем внутри Хироптерры, несмотря на все попытки бармена успокоить пони. Как раз в тот момент, когда хозяин заведения решил прибегнуть к крайним мерам, он заметил то, что заставило его сердце уйти в копыта: хорошо одетый фестрал в сопровождении небольшой свиты вооружённых пони вошёл в его паб. Отряд военачальника, без сомнения. На данный момент солдаты, казалось, лишь наблюдали за разворачивающимся хаосом.\n\nКто—то в толпе выкрикнул громче остальных — Да! Этому месту конец! Кто нас спасёт, когда в дверь постучатся мыши, чтобы поработить нас и наших сородичей?! \n\nФестрал ухмыльнулся, а затем харизматично ответил — Ну, я, конечно! \n\nБольшинство посетителей паба повернулись к вошедшему незнакомцу. Некоторые были озадачены, других охватило подозрение. А ты ещё кто такой? — спросил один из них. \n\nПозволь—ка мне рассказать кое—что тебе, — сказал фестрал, запрыгивая на один из столов, — Все эти истории, которые вы рассказывали о Хироптерре? Всё это правда. Всё, что вы сказали. И я знаю это, потому, что я, Уоллнат Драйв, вырвался из их лап много лет назад. А это значит, что только я смогу защитить вас от них. \n\nБыло ли это из-за алкоголя или очаровательной улыбки Уоллнат, толпа, казалось, поверила его заверениям, к большому облегчению бармена."
tobuck_wallnut.2.a:0 "Может быть, он действительно знает, что делает."

tobuck_wallnut.3.t:0 "Награда за победу" ###Garion
tobuck_wallnut.3.d:0 "— Как вы можете видеть, генералиссимус, легионеры Хироптерры отступили в... э—э, сэр? Может, нам зайти к вам чуть позже?\n\nУоллнат стоял неподвижно, пока портной снимал с него мерки для новой униформы. — Чушь! Продолжайте, пожалуйста. Он ухмыльнулся. В последнее время Драйв слышал только хорошие новости о своих войсках, и поэтому решил обзавестись шикарным новым снаряжением, чтобы отпраздновать свой неизбежный триумф. Его лейтенанты не могли не задаться вопросом, почему он решил сделать это в командном пункте из всех возможных мест.\n\nЛейтенанты к которым он обращался коротко переглянулись, а затем один из них продолжил — Что ж, сэр, оставшиеся силы мышей бежали в сельскую местность. Их цепь командования рухнула, когда мы захватили их города, и по большей части освобождённые населённые пункты полностью целы. Однако большинство арсеналов и складов с оружием были разрушены до того, как мы смогли добраться до них, и...\n\n— Попридержи—ка эту мысль, — перебил пони Уоллнат. Он нахмурился, глядя на карту Хироптерры на центральном столе. Мгновение спустя его глаза заблестели, и он улыбнулся своим подчинённым. — Этот огромный отель в столице всё ещё цел? У него вроде ещё название было "Дримскейп".\n\n— Ну, наверное? Нью Аякачтли был относительно нетронут. Но я не понимаю, как это—\n\n— Немедленно обезопасьте его. — генералиссимус в волнении хлопнул копытами, к большому неудовольствию своего портного, который всё ещё пытался снять мерки.\n\nЕсли раньше его помощники просто недоумевали, то теперь они были совершенно сбиты с толку. — При всём уважении, сэр... Зачем? \n\nУхмылка Уоллната становилась всё шире и шире по мере того, как его воображение рисовало всё более красочные картины — Несомненно, все победы должны быть отпразднованы. У меня тоже есть план на этот счёт..."

Его кости заныли, когда он встал с роскошной кровати, предоставленной ему. Удивительно, но то, что он был одним из наименее известных говорящих с Луной в Хироптерре позволило ему получить приглашение остановиться во дворце Уоллната. Хотя он считал вопиющее пренебрежение отступника к учениям Найтмер еретическим, он не мог не чувствовать, что молодой жеребец был просто введён в заблуждение, и что военачальнику ещё не поздно изменить свой путь. \n\n— Тоже не можешь уснуть, 'товарищ'? Если тебя так конечно можно назвать?\n\nДаск потёр глаза. В холле сидел пожилой земной пони и курил сигарету. Уэйн вспомнил, что видел его несколько раз раньше. Какой—то старый неисправимый марксист из Мейргипета. Его вроде звали Нифтин, верно? — У этих молодых столько энергии, что я и не думал, что такое возможно. Мне просто нужно подышать свежим воздухом. Так что, если вы не возражаете, я пойду своей дорогой.\n\nНифтин покачал головой — Вам будет трудно найти тихое место в этом дворце, Даск. Я знаю Уоллната уже давно. В каждом уголке этого места будет кипеть жизнь, пока все они не рухнут от усталости.\n\n— Тогда почему бы тебе не присоединиться к ним, 'товарищ'? Этот зал и так мог бы быть немного менее оживлённым.\n\n— Я никогда не был сторонником торжеств, в которых не участвуют бедные и несчастные, — Нифтин затянулся сигаретой. — Здесь, в Тобуке, их всё ещё довольно много, далеко за пределами роскоши этого дворца.\n\n— Там далеко... — Даск чуть не повысил голос, но потом понял, что на самом деле согласен с утверждением другого жеребца. Он подошёл, чтобы прислониться к той же стене, что и Нифтин, и глубоко вздохнул — Да. Может быть, мы сможем согласиться с одним фактом. Даск взглянул на другого жеребца, который протягивал ещё одну сигарету, предлагая закурить ему. Уэйн усмехнулся и взял её. — Может быть, даже с двумя фактами."

Both he and Home Brew were more than a little concerned for their own safety, but at least the latter wasn’t a complete nervous wreck.\n\nThe less anxious of the two stallions tried to offer kind words, “Hey, come on. We’ll be fine. A couple of stops on the way and we’re out before the sun sets; nothing will happen to us.”\n\n“I-It’s not…” Bean started, immediately needing to catch his breath before continuing. “Waiting m-makes it… w-worse…” He managed after a moment.\n\nGiven the very real risk that they could be shot as traitors for the duration of their wait, that was reasonable. Luckily they were unlikely to be recognised, so long as Wallnut himself didn’t trott into the café they were trying to relax in.\n\n“Ain’t much worse than waiting, I couldn’t agree more!” A familiar voice gave out loudly.\n\nOh buck.\n\nBean jumped out of his skin and pressed himself against the wall of their booth whilst his friend simply stared wide-eyed at their unexpected guest. He was right there, right in front of them. Did he come in here to get something on the way back to the palace? At this point it seemed more likely that the universe simply wanted to spite them.\n\n“All good? You both look like you’ve just fallen head-first into Tartarus!” The Generalissimo added, unbothered by their utter terror. “Well, was just lookin’ for you two; I’ve got a party lined up for us all at some fancy hotel. I’ll see you both there, eh?”\n\nAnd just like that, he was gone as soon as he had appeared. The two remaining and utterly mortified ponies looked at one another with complete understanding."

To be fair he hadn’t had much choice when the car and an armoured transport full of soldiers had turned up to his temporary residence, but it didn’t make Carrot Stick any more comfortable. Just because they hadn’t explicitly forced him into the vehicle didn’t mean this wasn’t some sort of trap, though equally he could believe that Wallnut was throwing some sort of ‘party’ at the expense of thestral dignity.\n\nA few more minutes of watching the world go by out of the tinted windows and they had arrived at the hotel, only to be greeted by the pony himself.\n\n“Well if it ain’t Carrot Stick! How’ve you been since we saw each other last?” The warlord asked gleefully, trotting over without a care in the world.\n\nOf course they’d never actually met, what with Wallnut being a traitor and an apostate, but they had known of each other for many years. Unfortunately the civil servant was very far from fond of the mercenary commander despite his unusually reformist outlook on governance. He simply said nothing and sighed; letting his head hang slightly.\n\n“Well, lemme know if you want anything before the celebrations start. I’ll be inside if you need me.” The rebel offered with surprising humility, at least making an effort towards reconciliation.\n\nAnother car, similarly escorted, had arrived and unloaded as the Generalissimo casually trotted away. Rose Rain looked just as unnerved as Carrot, which was why they drifted towards one another as they slowly made their way inside the hotel.\n\n“He could do so much for this place, but his first port of call is to party.” The mare gave out, clearly as disappointed by the host as she was confused and annoyed.\n\nHe hadn’t intended to speak to anyone here, but that comment had caught the thestral off guard. “Quite. All that power and charisma, wasted on alcohol and music.”\n\n“A Chiropterran statespony agreeing with a harmonist… Small world, huh?”\n\nAt that, Carrot Stick smiled."

Some scuffles broke out, the outside of the hotel was utter chaos and Wallnut was nowhere to be found.\n\nThose that had half a mind to save more than just themselves tried to look for him, but apparently he had disappeared into thin air.

Вино также очень ценно, когда оно не вытекает из разбитых бутылок, и поэтому... Подожди, ты это слышал?\n\nИз—за нескольких больших бочек в задней части подвала послышался протяжный стон. Два товарища посмотрели друг на друга, затем медленно выглянули из—за бочек. Там лежал пьяный пони, ноги которого были раскинуты во все стороны, а из нескольких недопитых бутылок вина было вилито их содержимое на пол и на форму единственного и неповторимого Уоллнат Драйва. Он открыл глаза, икнул, затем полуулыбнулся старшим пони. — Привет, ребята... как —ик— вы?\n\nДаск испустил долгий вздох. Серьёзно, Тобук докатился до этого? Теперь это место, где 'важные' пони веселяться весь день, в то время как вокруг них вспыхивают беспорядки? Его кости начинали болеть от одной мысли об этом.

Пожалуйста —ик— скажи мне, что я могу сделать, чтобы помочь тебе почувствовать себя —ик— лучше...\n\nДаск и Нифтин снова посмотрели друг на друга.

Sneaking in, drunk as the entire hotel may have been, clearly hadn’t been worth the risk.\n\nRose Rain hoofed over the bits of paper with a frown, “Not entirely fruitless though, now we know for sure that we should get out before-”\n\nJust as the thestral went to replace the ‘documents’ in a convincingly messy fashion, the bathroom door creaked loudly open. The uninvited guests could only stop and stare as they watched a barely-clothed and terribly hungover Wallnut step out, toothbrush firmly locked between his teeth. Clad in only a towel to cover his hindquarters, the stallion simply glanced at both of them and shrugged before going back into the bathroom to spit out the toothpaste.\n\nA moment later he returned, cleared his throat and held out a hoof. “Ugh... Look, I’m gonna be honest; I need your help. I’m... I'm gonna put on some clothes, try and figure out what in Tartarus is going on and do my best to get things sorted. Once things look a little less chaotic... Mmm...

Meanwhile Wallnut, also in the office as the leader, is filling in a crossword puzzle until he puts the paper down and offers his take. Jus have both!

He often wondered how the Generalissimo had gotten to this point. To rise above all the other warlords in Tobuck and unite the small country under his banner. Against all odds, he had defeated the mighty legions of Chiropterra as well. To an outside observer, one might think that Wallnut was a strategic genius and destined for greatness, perhaps he was, but Dusk knew what he was really like.\n\nWallnut was a buffoon. A charismatic buffoon for sure, but not a threat. No, the real threat was Niftyn who had already managed to gather several hardline communists under his leadership in Tobuck. Even though they had shared some drinks at the hotel, Dusk knew that their visions for the future were too incompatible with one another for them to truly cooperate. Already lines were being drawn and factions were gaining ground. A civil war was out of the question, but the future of the U.L.N.Z. would be decided not by any public grandstanding from Wallnut.

How could a new government that has torn down everything they believed in possibly have their best interest in mind?\n\nAs the workers approached the front entrance, a few well-dressed ponies exited the building. The well-dressed ponies introduced themselves to the workers, saying that they were with the United Labour Front. Many of the workers were confused and had inquired as to what that was.\n\n"A union meant to ensure the well-being of every labourer in Chiropterra! One of Dusk Wane's recently implemented programs!" they had explained. The workers seemed hesitant to believe them, but nicer and safer working conditions did sound appealing. Many of the workers stopped briefly to inquire further, figuring that the promises they were making seemed too good to be true.\n\nBut as they began their workday, it soon became clear that the new working conditions were much, much better than they used to be. Fear and worry dissipated almost instantly amongst them. One worker gave a last look to a wall where some graffiti of Nightmare Moon used to be. It was almost completely wiped away; only a faint remnant of the old faith remained."

tobuck_wallnut.38.d:0 "Though it had been some time since Wallnut's forces had devastated her hometown on the outskirts of New Ayacachtli, Pond Watch still found it difficult to accept the new reality of her situation as a Moonspeaker. Her local temple had been almost completely demolished, and when the time came to rebuild it, she was shocked when the new government had declared that Nightmare Moon had twisted their faith over the ages into a monstrosity. They said that all temples needed to be reshaped or reformed to depict the "old faith" of the rising Moon holding dominion over the night sky.\n\nPond had felt conflicted about this then, but when she had stepped back to think about all of the horrible things that her faith had done to those who rejected Nightmare Moon she realized that she too had become prejudiced towards the nonbelievers.\n\nWhen she joined the volunteer efforts to rebuild the temple, both Pond and several of her old friends were surprised to see each other there. Pond had exclaimed that she had resolved to save the faith from its wrongdoings and to help bring the light of the Moon back to all who needed it.\n\nShe was brought out of her thoughts when a bell rang, signifying that the reconstruction workers, many of whom didn't even share her religion, were about to arrive for lunch. She hoped that at least this gesture of kindness could help atone for her own sins. Pond smiled at the hungry ponies as they entered the room."

Federal Police detachments have been stretched thin thanks in part to the very recent creation of the force but primarily as a result of the widespread legionary resistance following the conflict.\n\nIn spite of the great danger posed to the police and the public, they have done a remarkable job in containing the Chiropterran fanatics. Several informant arrests have been made and a number of raids have been entirely prevented thanks to the work of our brave constables on night patrol. Unfortunately, resistance remains a serious problem.\n\nFor now the army has taken on some of the more dangerous roles that would be typically left to the jurisdiction of the police, an unsurprising level of cooperation given the circumstances. Whilst Dusk Wane has voiced his intentions to fully hoof over civil duties to the police once the Legionnaires run out of steam for good, the destruction that these devoted elites cause begets a continued vigilance."

Their numbers, supplies and morale are at an all time low. They haven’t much fight left in them.” The pegasus shakily replied, either intimidated or simply still surprised.\n\nWalnut laughed and sat back in his chair, “You ain’t on duty Brass, you can sound less ‘official’ than that!”\n\nActually, he was on duty; or at least he was supposed to be. Unfortunately one cannot simply say no to the Generalissimo, especially if he wants to take you somewhere to celebrate.\n\nHe would have found the irony irritating, if it weren’t for how well-spirited the comment was. “As you say, Wallnut.

He mulled over all that had transpired since he first became a Moonspeaker. The fall of his homeland and his newfound status in the country that had conquered it.\n\nDusk briefly closed his eyes. The time to put Chiropterra to rest had come.\n\nHe turned his attention to the crowd in front of him. "Brothers and sisters of New Ayacachtili, I have come to you this evening to tell you of the sins of the Legionary Council. They who practiced blind obedience to the Nightmare are the reason why Chiropterra lost so many lives in a pointless war. They who were so prideful that they failed to see how corrupted their faith had become over generations. They who thought of themselves as invincible to the end, and it was you all who paid the price for it.\n\n"The Legionary Council is no more. Scattered to the wind, much like the national pride many of you once felt. Some of you may still feel this way. Pride in Chiropterra, pride in the Nightmare; but that is not the way forward! Our Tobuckian brothers and sisters are offering us help in reforging this land into one our children can be proud of! We will not earn our salvation by merely praying for it, we must work for it! Join in labour with those around you and help bring this land out of the darkness of the Nightmare and into the light of the Old Moon!\n\n"That very light shines upon us now! The Old Moon has always watched over us. It has done so long before the Nightmare existed and it will do so after the last memory of the Nightmare fades away. It is eternal, much like its capacity for forgiveness. We must restore the old faith, the true faith. And if all of this is too much, then I only ask one thing of you...""

tobuck_wallnut.42.d:0 "A hoofball union, public facilities union, handypony union… He had been reading the most recently compiled list for some time already, but that was the point at which Dusk Wane decided that he had seen enough. The thestral’s push for unions as a broader part of society and politics had worked, it seemed. New unions cropped up every day and very few of them seemed to be unsuccessful; in fact it seemed as though the boundaries between classes were slowly breaking down as more and more unique organisations developed around particular subjects that interested every strata of citizen.\n\nJust today he had been inspecting a proposal from the FAU - the Fine Art Union - which had petitioned to collect and present historical pieces from all across the federation in a new museum. The old pony smiled and sighed, deciding then that he would accept it when he was next in his office. After all, even socialist progress was always built upon a foundation of history; no matter what that history might be. If a union wished to preserve the artefacts of old, he could oblige such a request.\n\nNiftyn would probably have had the FAU shut down if he’d had the chance, much like many of the other unions that he considered ‘pointless’; perhaps all of them would go eventually. It was truly a shame that they disagreed on so many of the finer details of socialism; maybe once things were said and done they could sit and chat about why he was so enamoured with Steel Stallion, a question to which he would likely respond by asking why Dusk was so enamoured with religion."

"I'll let you know when it's time to see the surprise."\n\n---\n\nThe next day, after he was all done with his farmwork, Zagrum brought his son over to the town. They spent the rest of the afternoon watching the construction workers set up more of those wooden poles, along with some metal ones scattered around the town square. As the sun began to set, Zagrum's son asked if they could go home, as he was scared of the dark. Shaking his head, Zagrum watched one of the construction workers close a maintenance panel. He bore a huge smile and patted his son on the head.\n\n"Don't worry, soon you'll never have to be scared of the dark ever again."\n\nWith a flick of a switch, electrical lights blinked on all around them, piercing the approaching darkness and casting it out forevermore."

You want me to pick my poison?” Wallnut gave out, putting it into the simplest terms for himself.\n\nThe other thestral at the table nodded and went to explain further, “Exactly. They’re an experiment of sorts; to see what works and what doesn’t, what sort of infrastructure we need to have in place and whether the investments are worth the input cost.” Realising that giving more detail would probably send their host to sleep, Dusk then got straight to the point. “As this is new technology, it should be used for civilian purposes. It is only fair that such state investments benefit the citizenry first and foremost, factories operated by the workers and for the workers.”\n\nNiftyn went to scoff but instead coughed, taking a moment to clear his throat before speaking. “The workers will have nothing to call their own if we can’t protect what we’ve already worked so hard to build! The new facilities should be dedicated to military production, unless you wish to see the federation fall behind its enemies and shatter in a time of true crisis!”\n\nHaving received such an energetic rebuttal, the red moonspeaker went to argue; but Wallnut raised a hoof to make a choice and quell them both before he had to listen to another shouting match over policy."

The old marksist grinned, leaning forward and taking out his years-old pocket copy of the Communist Manifesto, tied tightly with string to an even smaller volume of Steel Stallion’s memoirs. Both little books had been damaged and lovingly repaired over the years, just so he could keep them close should they ever be needed.\n\nAs the revolutionary flipped aimlessly through the pages, he couldn’t help but think of Wallnut; or, more specifically, of what Wallnut was and wasn’t. He and that thestral were close friends with a relationship forged in the blood and fire of battle, but they did not see eye-to-eye when it came to politics. In all fairness, the Generalissimo was at least consistent. It wasn’t that he disliked communism, far from it, more that he detested any and all forms of state management. He liked making friends first and foremost, which was sadly not part of the plan that two great authors of his most prized possessions had laid out. A socialist utopia must be led, guided by a visionary under the founding principles of the revolution as they had laid out. Though Dusk Wane and his puppets might disagree, anything less was abject failure.\n\nThat was how he saw the future of the federation and of Zebrica.

That didn’t stop this Niftyn fellow from annoying him by making a fuss about class, of course.\n\nWhen his daughter had asked to go to one of their rallies, that was when the alarm bells started ringing in his head. Not just about her - there were a lot of unsavoury individuals at these events after all - but also about how effective the propaganda had clearly been in getting ponies to at least attend even if they didn’t listen.\n\nEventually he agreed to take her, realising that explaining politics and the concept of an ideology was far too complex for a ten-year-old and that talking about the funny shouty stallion after the fact would be far easier.\n\nThe red flags, the pamphlets and the officials bustled amongst the crowd as some jumped up demagogue stood at the front. They were rambling on about tearing down ‘the decadent rule of monarchy, despots and kleptocrats’ and how the federation must become a ‘bastion of communism’. It was difficult to hear, here at the back of the worryingly large crowd, but at least his little filly seemed to be having a good time.

In a similar vein, a police force was needed to deal with less pressing concerns than domestic terrorism. To this, Niftyn proposed a very simple solution.\n\nAt the behest of the Generalissimo, the Internal Security Service has been formalised with the express intent to be used primarily as an anti-terrorist security force with the jurisdiction above that of the police and the firepower of the military. They are sworn to serve Wallnut first and foremost, but typically act on the orders of Niftyn simply so that the thestral can remain distant from bureaucracy.\n\nThough some within the government question the morality and rationality of such an extrajudicial force, none can deny the immediate effect that the ISS has had on Chiropterran resistance.

Communism shall not splutter and falter as it did under those who marred the vision of its founders!"

Parades were largely state affairs, but all he had to do was smile and wave to his adoring fans; what could be better than that?\n\nAs the thestral rode in a personalised tank, Niftyn was preparing an address to go out to newspapers and across radio stations throughout the federation. It was to be an announcement, and a very good one at that. Though he clearly didn’t know it - or at least liked not to talk about it -  the Generalissimo was little more than a military commander, in spite of his popularity.\n\nToday he would be declared ‘Steel Generalissimo’ by him and the Hazrumenian Communist Party as a whole, a title which he would obviously accept. Whilst he revelled in the immediate adoration from the public, his compliance in the bestowing of such a title would make him essentially a puppet of the party and of Niftyn. Wallnut would notice little difference of course, all politics was the same to him so long as he could make friends and have a good time; that was something that nopony planned to change.\n\nWhat was soon to disappear was Dusk Wane’s political influence. More and more creatures flocked to the HCP every day and with this affirmation from their much-adored dictator any political resistance would rapidly evaporate.\n\nThe stallion wished he could have the privilege of seeing old Dusky’s face when he got the news."

tobuck_baragzen.2.d:0 "Барагзен во время своей утренней рутины точно не ожидал, что небольшая группа жеребцов, состоящих из одних пони, попытается добиться аудиенции у него в его собственном доме. Они неторопливо шли по просёлочной дороге, пока зебра с хмурым видом грызла особенно дорогой цветок, желая только одного — прогнать их прочь.\n\nИ всё же, опасаясь за свою репутацию и святость своего поместья, лорд подошёл к своей двери, пока они приближались к его дому. Излишне говорить, что его незваные гости были весьма удивлены, увидев, что он открыл им как раз в тот момент, когда они собирались постучать.\n\nПоловина из них поклонилась, а другая инстинктивно отдала честь, в то время как одна пони подошла, чтобы заговорить с ним — Приношу извинения за раннее беспокойство, сэр — Спринг Брииз к вашим услугам. У вас найдётся минута для нас?\n\n— Я слушаю. — Он просто хмыкнул, делая глоток какого-то напитка, который они не смогли рассмотреть.\n\nЕдинственный единорог в группе вышел вперёд и разгрузил свою седельную сумку, достав из неё небольшую стопку документов. Барагзен приподнял бровь, услышав это, но быстро всё понял, как только увидел знакомую печать вербовочного бюро королевской гвардии. Всем им было отказано в приёме в подразделения стражей клятвы просто потому, что они были пони, а не зебрами — единственной расой, которой в настоящее время разрешалось занимать такую престижную должность. В конце концов, в легендах никогда ничего не упоминалось о пони.\n\nСпринг начала подробно объяснять их проблему, но зебра подняла своё копыто показывая, что в этом не было необходимости. Он всё прекрасно понял.\n\nЕсли бы он допустил пони в свои ряды, это было бы оскорблением тех самых мифов, что породили королевскую гвардию. Но в то же время эти ограничения, безусловно, были непрактичными, так как большинство населения Тобука — пони. После того, как он дал очень неопределённое, но убедительное обещание группе и вернулся внутрь, Барагзен провёл большую часть дня, размышляя о будущем своей самой ценной части армии."

Это не был его обычный способ провести вторую половину рабочего дня, но обстоятельства вынудили его отменить пару пунктов из его дневного расписания. Ему был просто необходим короткий перерыв. Буквально два часа назад его секретарь сообщил ему о предложении Барагзена, в котором даже не было классической угрозы арестовать грифона за деловую халатность.\n\nРезультатом этого предложения стало его назначение на должность мэра Тобука. Ну, такого названия эта работа конечно пока не имела, но слово ‘мэр’ идеально отображало его новые обязанности и полномочия по управлению экономикой.\n\nУчитывая, что происходило — особенно сильно его настораживали региональные политические проблемы — Василе всерьёз задумывался исчезнуть отсюда, что всё ещё было возможно. Просто потому, что он принял пост премьер—министра в регионе с намерением заработать как можно больше денег вместе со своими партнёрами, не обязательно означало, что у него не было других вариантов. Если бы Хироптерра или Зарантия начали стучаться, у него всё ещё была бы стратегия отступления; но подыгрывать было бы разумно, по крайне мере сейчас.\n\nВ целом, выходило, что это этот парень Барагзен был очень полезной зеброй,особенно потому, что он судя по всему не знал о разных экономических злоупотреблениях Василе. Во всяком случае всё это может в конечном итоге оказаться одним из самых прибыльных начинаний в его карьере за всё время, особенно если лорд—изгнанник продолжит перекладывать экономические заботы на его подчинённых без особого надзора.\n\nОн должен был организовать для себя и своего нового работодателя какую—нибудь вечеринку, на которую он мог бы пригласить гостей. В конце концов, даже самым худшим существам в мире нужно время от времени надевать маску с приятным выражением лица, если они хотят чего—то добиться."

Разве она не всегда такая милая… — Он рассмеялся, наполовину в шутку, наполовину всерьёз.\n\nЛорд взял со стола кусок вяленой рыбы и скормил его удивительно послушному зверю, в то время как его гости смотрели на это со смесью благоговения и замешательства. До сих пор лорд не проявлял особой способности к эксцентричности или потаканию своим желаниям, а в таком поступке было немного и того, и другого.\n\nЯрикх и несколько других зебр всё же относились к животному весьма доброжелательно, время от времени подкладывая ей несколько кусочков еды, когда они шли наполнять свои тарелки за столом различными угощениями обычными для званых обедов. Конечно, Барагзен и сам позаботился о том, чтобы у него было вдоволь еды; он был вполне доволен тем, что сидел, ел и разговаривал со своей довольно большой компанией гостей.\n\nДействительно, это было довольно приятное занятие, когда лорд получал множество похвал за свои подвиги, которые он милостиво принимал. Все присутствующие относились к нему с величайшим уважением — почти как если бы он уже был членом королевской семьи, — и ему это очень нравилось.\n\nВ какой-то момент особенно непринуждённо он даже пошутил — Слишком много этих вечеринок, и я могу потеряться в них!"

Пони, которого он назначил для репортажа о конфликте, до сих пор проделывал такую отличную работу, что ни один из них не ожидал, что солдаты просто отступят и вернутся домой после такой тяжёлой войны.\n\nЕму пришлось бы позвонить операторам печатного станка, и заставить их, по крайней мере, немедленно остановиться, но тогда чем бы он заменил страницы?\n\nВ комнату ворвалась ещё одна его сотрудница, сжимая карандаш с почти безумным выражением в усталых глазах. — У меня есть то, что нам нужно, сэр! У нас есть что поместить на обложку! — выпалила она, бросаясь к его столу и выкладывая какие-то нацарапанные планы.\n\n— Хвала богам, — Он вернулся, вздыхая с облегчением и потирая подаренные ему простыни. — Что ты принесла для меня?\n\nБлант Лид поняла, что он скорее всего не сможет прочитать и половины материала, и начала объяснять, — Мы попытались сосредоточить внимание читателей на том, как наши войска возвращают огромные богатства в Тобук, вместо того, чтобы тратить слишком много времени на описание самого договора. И вы знаете, что они сделают, если мы опишем его слишком негативным.\n\n— Хорошо, хорошо. Это просто прекрасно. Я отправлю это в печать. — Жеребец собрался уходить, запихивая документы в портфель, который он вскоре отправит на их склады.\n\n— Подождите, подождите! Мы не определились с заголовком; вот, выберите между этими двумя по дороге!\n\nОна лихорадочно нацарапала записку, которую он сжал зубами, после чего галопом выбежал из своего кабинета, получив возможность рассмотреть варианты только после того, как спустился на три лестничных пролёта."

А теперь он обладает мощью армии наёмников, превратившейся в профессиональную силу, и медленно централизует власть при поддержку других видных изгнанников в Тобуке. Ходят слухи, что он уже установил контакт с консервативными элементами в нашем правительстве. В то же время общественное восприятие постепенно перешло от пассивного веселья над сумасшедшим в газетах к осознанию реальности вероятности его возвращения.\n\nЕщё больше беспокойства вызывает то, что он претендует на трон Варзены как глава древней династии Леопардов, что делает цели его неизбежных завоеваний в будущем слишком очевидными.

У Ярикха, Танис и Джетзабела не было особых причин не доверять друг другу, но, какими бы разными они ни были, у них было мало причин относится дружелюбно друг к другу. Это было его частью предложенной сделки, объединяющей всё, что осталось от дворянства, которое могло противостоять слабому королю. Пока он остаётся спокойным и собранным, они, без сомнения, будут сотрудничать; по крайней мере, в обозримом будущем.\n\nГруппа вышла с территории и попала в небольшую зону отдыха с полукруглой скамейкой, на которую каждая зебра уселась, чтобы хозяин мог выступить. — Итак, теперь мне нет необходимости повторять условия нашего соглашения; действительно, само ваше присутствие здесь указывает на то, что вы, пусть и предварительно, уже приняли его. Тем не менее, поскольку в настоящее время я скорее простой джентльмен, нежели король, я счёл нужным пригласить вас к себе домой, чтобы обсудить дела в более интимной обстановке.\n\nЭто явно несколько успокоило группу, которая была рада услышать, что он был серьёзным и отнюдь не дураком, несмотря на его отчуждённое поведение.\n\nЯрикх заговорил первым — такой же изгнанник, он, без сомнения, стремился вернуть то, что он потерял. — До тех пор, пока мои старые владения будут возвращены и безопасность моей семьи и положения могут быть обеспечены... Что ж, эта сделка более чем приемлема.\n\n— С дополнением в виде сохранения наших текущих претензий на землю и собственность, конечно же. — быстро добавил Джетзабел, стремясь получить как можно больше, насколько это было возможно в данных обстоятельствах.\n\nБарагзен повернулся и посмотрел на Танис, которая, казалось, была глубоко погружена в свои мысли. Вероятно, она рассматривала свою потенциальную роль в возрождении их традиционной веры, проект, к осуществлению которого она стремилась в течение многих лет.\n\n— Я приношу извинения за свои медленные размышления, но это потенциально очень опасное решение. — объяснила она, получив понимающий кивок от Барагзена и заставив двух других гостей переглянуться. — Я, однако, крайне заинтересована в сотрудничестве; возможно, я не должна беспокоиться.\n\nИх хозяин улыбнулся и хлопнул копытами в едва скрываемом ликовании,"

До сих пор ты проделывал отличную работу, мой друг. На самом деле я даже хочу вознаградить тебя за твою прекрасную службу. — предложил он с нехарактерно искренней улыбкой.\n\nВ ответ на это Василе вежливо покачал головой, — Это очень любезно с вашей стороны, мой сеньор, но моя служба под началом истинного короля Варзены — это уже подарок сам по себе.\n\nВозможно, это была самая величайшая ложь, которую грифон когда-либо говорил, поскольку он уже обдумывал, сколько мог бы заработать, расширяя свою политику спекуляции. Тобук процветал так хорошо, как никогда раньше, и он следил за тем, чтобы вместе с этим получать прибыль; инсайдерская торговля, тщательная организация налоговых льгот в растущих отраслях, в которых у него были контрольные доли, и ещё множество политик, которые большинство сочло бы ‘коррумпированными’, проводимых по всей стране… Возможности были поистине огромны, но не было бы ничего хорошего в том, чтобы показаться Барагзену амбициозным.\n\nЕго смирение возымело желаемый эффект, и зебра надменно рассмеялась, совершенно не подозревая, как много ускользает в когти его собственного подчинённого. — Конечно, ты шутишь! Я не смог найти никого более достойного повышения, только тебя!\n\nГрифон просто усмехнулся и поднял лапы в насмешливом неохотном согласии, поскольку у лорда, по-видимому, появилась искра идеи,"

Вдобавок ко всему само восстание, казалось, находилось в состоянии хаоса, процветая ещё больше из-за того, что король принял за вторжение.\n\nСудя по всему Барагзен был очень умным жеребцом, обеспечивающим, что любой конфликт, вспыхнувший между ним и Варзеной, будет рассматриваться не как война, а скорее как внутренняя междоусобица, которая распространилась на границы Тобука благодаря логистической, военной и национальной неразберихе. Даже вооружённые силы, казалось, не совсем были уверены в том, с кем они должны были сражаться. А какие генералы были связаны с истеблишментом, не знала ни одна зебра.\n\nИзлишне говорить, что это породило состояние полного беспорядка, и наши союзники, по-видимому, не желают действовать, опасаясь, что они могут выступить не на той стороне или что они могут спровоцировать дальнейший конфликт между враждующей знатью.

Сначала вмешательство в их дела казалось самым простым и правильным курсом действий, как это было бы при оказании помощи союзнику во время конфликта, но реальность сложилась совершенно не так, как мы ожидали.\n\nОтчасти благодаря тому, что наши линии связи были перерезаны, и общему хаосу, который, по—видимому, является нормой для всех аспектов государства Варзены, вторжение стало рискованным предложением.

Вся правящая оппозиция будет казнена, и это решение будет выполнено немедленно. Даже его копыто немного дрожало, когда он подписывал их смертные приговоры; никогда не было просто приказать убить другого, когда он был беззащитен, но в конечном счёте это было необходимо.\n\nКогда дело дошло до солдат и генералов, которые не принимали особого участия в боевых действиях, а также тех, кто дезертировал, то лорд был добр к ним. Солдаты сражаются, потому что это их работа, и их лояльность была необходима для того, чтобы обеспечить его власть. Кроме того, государственные служащие и другие простые люди были избавлены от гнева мстительного изгнанника; он нуждался в их одобрении так же сильно, как прошлый узурпатор нуждался в их согласии, а потому попросту не было необходимости наказывать их.\n\nВ столице Варзены зебры медленно возвращались к своей обычной жизни, ожидая прибытия Барагзена и его неизбежной коронации. Дворяне, которые встали на его сторону, уже готовились к этому событию, а также приводили в порядок улицы, принимая надлежащие меры для возвращения давно отвергнутой династии. Даже Василе иногда можно было заметить, когда он обходил улицы и дворец, чтобы убедиться, что всё в порядке."

tobuck_baragzen.13.d:0 "Вопреки ожиданиям, церемония была относительно небольшой и закрытой. Некоторые её элементы были возрождёнными обрядами с древних врёмен, в то время как другие были совершенно новыми; действительно, Барагзен чудесным образом приобрёл совершенно новый набор роскошных королевских артефактов и пышную одежду специально для церемонии, чтобы ему не нужно было прикасаться к испорченной короне слабого короля.\n\nСейчас началась та часть, к которой ему действительно нужно было подготовиться. Новый правитель Варзены осторожно поднялся по красивой резной лестнице на балкон, с которого он должен был обратиться к своим верноподданным. Для того, чтобы огромные толпы простолюдинов и солдат, собравшихся, чтобы поприветствовать его, могли услышать его, было установлено множество микрофонов и динамиков. Одни были взволнованы, другие встревожены, и всем было интересно, как же этот новый король собирается править. Их ждал настоящий сюрприз.\n\nПодождав, пока утихнут аплодисменты, даже поощряя своих хозяев остановиться жестами копыта и тёплой улыбкой, Барагзен начал говорить. — Мои верноподданные, для меня и династии Леопардов большая честь наконец вернуться в это великое государство. Слишком долго вы томились под властью слабого монарха, который принёс вам и остальной части нашей некогда процветающей нации не что иное, как ужасный застой и полное подчинение иностранным державам. Хватит! Я заявляю — долой их! Мы одержали победу над опаснейшей угрозой рукокрылых! Мы одержали победу над слабостью и разложением, и мы одерживаем победу над всеми вызовами, которые стоят перед нами! — объявил он, остановившись только для того, чтобы перевести дыхание и понаблюдать за разнообразной реакцией толпы.\n\n — В эпоху иностранного империализма и нестабильности мы будем процветать; но недостаточно просто процветать перед лицом более серьёзных врагов. Если мы хотим выжить и возродить наше давно утраченное наследие, мы должны начать конкуренцию с нашими врагами! Мы должны бороться, и мы должны победить! Гиппогрифы и кольтфагенцы будут бояться мощи Замаль-Барагзена, короля Варзены и повелителя Нео-Хазруменской империи!"

tobuck_alesia.1.d:0 "A young regime without internal alliances is doomed to failure. That was something that Alesia had learned from Severyana as the nobles had alienated all possible support bases for their rule in the years before the revolution.\n\nKnowing this, she had an important choice to make. Two warlords in Tobuck remained and she needed the support of one to guarantee a victory against the other. Baragzen, an exiled noble with a reputation for capriciousness, was one. The other was Wallnut, a radical known for his skill and zealous commitment to revolutionary ideals.\n\nNeither were perfect candidates, but she quickly came to the conclusion that…"

tobuck_alesia.2.d:0 "Though her program of Severyanian repatriation had brought many lost ponies to Tobuck it had brought few gifts and, as of yet, none of this calibre. Alesia had just been granted an immense sum of money from a particularly wealthy exile who, in spite of her limited repute, was apparently enamoured by her successes thus far.\n\nHer aide, one Entin Miron, stood with her as they watched the ship of the kind donor unload in port. “Commander, I’m of the opinion that we should use this money to modernise our weapon stockpiles; it’s high time that we retired our old materiel.”\n\n“Without the facilities required to produce them en masse, we may end up with too few weapons overall; though you are right to say that our current stockpile is worryingly outdated.” She retorted, though appreciative of his insight.\n\nQuantity or quality, industrial prowess or improved equipment.

tobuck_alesia.3.d:0 "Another small stack of paper, another list of potential candidates. Alesia had almost lost hope for the various lineages of Severyana by now, having spent years looking over the most distant of cousins and the most absurd family trees. Nevertheless, new claimants were found every now and then; though few held any interest in the position of Tsar.\n\nA profile of five new ponies had been compiled for her, but none of them were particularly impressive. A drunk, a lunatic, somepony that was old enough to die before she could possibly hope to reclaim the homeland and another two that were at least relatively promising. Even so, they were far from perfect; one was hardly active with the exiled community and another didn’t even live in Equus anymore.\n\nAlesia sighed and rubbed her forehead with her right hoof, staring at the papers for a moment before standing up and trotting over to one of many filing cabinets in her office."

tobuck_alesia.4.t:0 "The Importance of Faith" #Lerri
tobuck_alesia.4.d:0 "Strolling the gardens of the presidential palace at night, Alesia thought back to what she'd seen earlier that day. Ponies and zebras gathered together outside for a ceremony honouring one of their gods, singing hymns together under the scorching Zebrican sun. These creatures had nothing: although Alesia's governance had rooted out much of the corruption and decadence of the criminal-elite, she was under no illusions. These creatures, her creatures, had no security, they had no heritage, they were surrounded by enemies, and most of them owned little more than the clothes on their backs. And yet they had their faith.\n\nPerhaps that was why the red devils hated religion so, she thought, gazing up at the moon. They could take home, family, property and nation away from honest creatures, but in order to truly break them they had to also take their gods. Alesia had never been a particularly religious mare, but she swore then and there that she would not run a secular state. Tobuck would be united in faith, just as soon as she had consolidated her rule enough to make it so.\n"And what shall I swear this to?" she mused aloud, remembering the moonlit rituals her family used to perform, so long ago."
tobuck_alesia.4.a:0 ""I guess I'll swear this to you.""

tobuck_alesia.5.t:0 "Victory Over Chiropterra"  #Lerri
tobuck_alesia.5.d:0 "The reports were grim. The financial and materiel cost of the war against Chiropterra had been high, but the occupation was quickly becoming even more expensive. Raids, terror attacks and all manner of resistance activity were rampant; but if they retreated from the territory then their regime of zealots would simply return under new leadership, one that would also wish see Tobuck annihilated. What choice did they have but to stay?\n\n“Good evening ma’am,” An unfamiliar voice gave out from behind her.\n\nAlesia stopped and started. She knew all of her servants personally; whoever this was, they were an intruder that had slipped past her guards. Instinctively she drew her pistol and wheeled about, pointing the weapon squarely at the forehead of the interloper.\n\nWithout hesitation or stutter she demanded an explanation, “Who are you and why didn’t you take the opportunity to kill me whilst my back was turned?”\n\n“Because I, a loyal servant of the Chiropterran Moonspeakers, was not ordered to take your life. I have been tasked with delivering this to you and nothing more.” The hooded zebra replied, hardly batting an eye.\n\nHe raised a hoof slowly into one of his robes’ pockets and drew out a small scroll, which he then placed on a cabinet. Alesia marched forward and took it, keeping her gaze firmly planted on her uninvited guest all the while.\n\nShe turned to the still-open door and called out, “Guards! Take this stallion away!”\n\nThe zebra nodded slowly, before sitting on the floor and starting to pray in a language she didn’t understand. Recognising that he wasn’t a threat, Alesia holstered her weapon and read the note as a cacophony of friendly hooves thundered down the hallway to her quarters.\n\nIt was an invitation."
tobuck_alesia.5.a:0 "She was on the phone to Entin within minutes."

tobuck_alesia.6.t:0 "Blessed of the Moon" #Lerri
tobuck_alesia.6.d:0 "Entin was pacing back and forth, his boots clacking against the stone of this abandoned house’s courtyard. He was convinced that this was a trap, which was a reasonable assumption to make all things considered. His commanding officer on the other hand thought this would be the precursor to some kind of ceasefire or conditional surrender. If the Chiropterran Moonspeakers wanted her dead, they would have killed her already by now.\n\nA collection of hooftsteps grabbed their attention. As promised, a group of moonspeakers headed by one just ahead of the rest approached them. Alesia waited for one in their number to speak.\n\n“Alesia Snezhnaya, I assume?”\n\nShe nodded, “And you are?”\n\nThe figure stepped into better view and smiled, “Lunar Hail; I am the representative for all Moonspeakers in Chiropterra.” She returned, stopping and bowing deeply before the warlord.\n\nThen the rest bowed too, following their leader’s example. They both knew of her, one of the most zealous and renowned authorities of their faith. Why was she here and, more importantly, why were they bowing?\n\nAlesia smiled, mostly out of surprise. “I see. Am I not your enemy, thanks to recent events?”\n\n“On the contrary, you deserve the utmost respect for your achievements. Only a worthy individual, one with the blessing of the Nightmare could defeat Her Imperial Majesty's legions and-”\n\n“These kind words are appreciated, but the longer this takes the more of my soldiers die fighting yours. What is the point of all this?” The pony cordially demanded.\n\nFor a moment Lunar looked displeased, but remembered then that her legion too was suffering. “Of course. To be blunt, we wish for you to rule over Chiropterra; the Nightmare blessed you with gifts and us with you, we shall not waste that opportunity.”"
tobuck_alesia.6.a:0 "Entin and Alesia stared at one another, dumbfounded."

tobuck_alesia.7.t:0 "To Whom We Are Sworn"
tobuck_alesia.7.d:0 "For a while there was silence. The terms for cooperation had been laid out, mostly by the Moonspeakers for fear that either party would displease the other. Alesia’s eyes slowly scanned the faces of the legion commanders, but they were difficult to read. In that respect, they were much like her.\n\nEmerald Light was the first to speak, glancing at Lunar Hail before resting her attention on their new ruler. “It’s the only reasonable solution. I do as the faith commands.”\n\nShe bowed and stepped back for the others to voice their minds.\n\n“So long as we maintain our status and keep our legions, I take no issue with this agreement. The Nightmare wills and I follow.” Autumn Breeze agreed, performing a similar act of respect.\n\nLightning Charm scowled, but nodded nonetheless. “I am displeased primarily with the performance of our military. I shall cooperate on the provision that I am permitted to reform the legions so that they never suffer such a loss again.”\n\nAlesia assented to that request, seeing as it would only benefit their combined armed forces. Then she looked to the two remaining figures, who looked somewhat ambivalent. Stone Palisade simply shrugged and bowed, knowing that this was the way forward and seeing their loss as demonstrative of the need for change. Eternal Eclipse was clearly disgruntled, but he made to speak.\n\n“I agree to the proposal, on the condition that I be permitted retire and that my position will be given to my grandson Lucent. I am too old now to reform Chiropterra on such a scale as this, but he shall be of much use to you.”\n\nThe warlord acceded, “That can be arranged.”"

tobuck_alesia.8.d:0 ""…and so it is with great pride and greater hope that I proclaim myself defender of the Nightmare’s faith and her faithful in Zebrica and across the world. This land belongs to me as your Tsaritsa and the Nightmare as your Goddess in equal measure.” Alesia gave out, finishing her speech and sighing with the knowledge that she would definitely still need the script during the address.\n\nThe familiar sound of Entin’s quick trot alerted her to his presence at the door to her office. He was still in uniform even at this hour of the night, but then so was she. They had both had a very long day.\n\nHe made a half-hearted smile, “Not bad. You sure know what to say to these zealots.”\n\n“Can we not do this right now?” She snapped immediately.\n\n“No. We can not not do this right now, especially not after you shot me down the first time. What in Tartarus are you doing, cooperating with these maniacs? You told me that your parents never got through to you!” He pressed, furrowing his brow at the attempt to push the question further down the road.\n\nAlesia set down the paper she had been reading from and lowered her head onto a wooden trunk with a grimace, looking at her long-time friend out of the corner of her eye.\n\n“They didn’t Ent, not like that anyway. I never accepted their faith for a number of reasons, but I never turned it away either. Right now I just want the violence to stop. We need it to stop.” She answered slowly, lifting her head and taking some long breaths.\n\nHe stood there silently, before nodding. “Promise me you’ll be careful with all this Nightmare stuff. I’m just worried about where it might lead, that’s all.”"
tobuck_alesia.8.a:0 "Her expression softened, “I’ll be careful, for you.”"

tobuck_alesia.9.t:0 "A Sovereign's Regalia"
tobuck_alesia.9.d:0 "All that time spent looking for a successor, only to become one. She had spent so long in Zebrica fighting for money, for Severyana and for a goal that always seemed so far away. Now here she was, with leadership thrust upon her in a fashion she could never have expected.\n\nThe medals she wore on her royal attire were numerous and heavy. Some were from her time in the Royal Guard, some were awarded during her time fighting for various factions in Zebrica and some had been bestowed by the Chiropeterrans. It was almost an alien feeling to be all dressed up like this now, so far away from home. But this was home now. Novaya Severyana would be her realm and her legacy, her nation and people to mould as she saw fit. Commanding an army was now commanding a state and a society, one that could be great but one that equally could never be quite what she had envisioned to settle down in.\n\nDespite it all, she felt an inkling of pride; in a roundabout sort of way she'd achieved what she had arrived in Zebrica to do. All that remained was to finish what she was now starting."

tobuck_alesia.10.t:0 "Our New Home"
tobuck_alesia.10.d:0 "Alesia watched the crew of the ship, a markedly out-of-date cruiser, lower a ramp onto the docks. They must have kept it in its original state out of nostalgia as she had with her uniform, though how anypony could have escaped the homeland with a vessel of such size was beyond her. Luck most likely, or it was one of the few ships that had been out of port during the revolution.\n\nThat train of thought was cut short as she watched its occupants disembark. A line of lower nobles, a few generals, some soldiers and a few average citizens exited their floating scrapheap; followed by the crew shortly afterwards. Though their number was few, this was more than she had been expecting. Even its people were now largely apathetic to the dream of reclaiming Severyana, but some heeding her call was better than none at all. They needed all of the exiles that they could get their hooves on and this was a start, if little more."

tobuck_alesia.11.d:0 "“Will you swear upon your honour, life and devotion to the Nightmare to govern the multitudinous creatures of the this new tsardom?” Lunar Hail started, beginning the ceremony proper with ancient oaths.\n\n“I solemnly swear that I shall.” Alesia returned, her voice echoing off of the cathedral walls.\n\n“Will you, with all the powers granted to you, rule for her will first and your wisdom second; with mercy for all your subjects?” The Moonspeaker continued, words booming out.\n\n“I will.”\n\n“Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the will the Nightmare and the true profession of her most holy gospel? Will you in all of your granted strengths maintain the oaths of your forefathers before you? Will you, with these gifts from our goddess that raises the moon, do all in your power to work in service of your people before all else?”\n\n“All this I promise to do. The things which I have before promised, I will perform and keep; so help me Nightmare.” She finished, wondering silently to herself whether their deity would be truly pleased with her ascension.\n\nSome more ceremony followed, the anointing and the providing; all without issue, as expected for an event so rehearsed as this. Alesia didn’t need to think much for those, only sit in her royal seat stoically until it was time to receive the newly made crown jewels. As Lunar placed the crown on her head and the seated dignitaries stood up to sing the old Severyanian anthem, Tsaritsa Alesia stood herself with a hoof to her chest and one thought in her mind."

tobuck_alesia.12.t:0 "Tsaritsa's Boredom"
tobuck_alesia.12.d:0 "This would have been dull even if she wasn’t Tsaritsa. This ceaseless debate about when Nightmare Night should be was farcical in the extreme, yet it was important enough to the faith that making the decision for them could be taken poorly. For whatever reason this argument seemed to transcend the usual waxist-revivalist divide on occasion and thus was seemingly impossible to resolve.\n\nOne half of the Moonspeakers wanted to keep the date as it was, seeing that there was really no reason to change it as it was already an anticipated national holiday. The others, taking the opportunity of new management to press their agenda, wished to rediscover the day of the year that it was originally supposed to be; as though it really mattered what time of the year that the Nightmare was celebrated. In Alesia’s mind the obvious time to do such a thing, if it mattered at all, would be the winter solstice. But, with the aggressive tone that was resurfacing for the third time today, she decided that this wasn’t her fight.\n\nThe monarch slumped in her seat and stifled a yawn as the shouting began again, tempted to pray for her slowly dwindling patience and sanity."

No matter what the zebra may or may not have done, his role as Moonspeaker was sacred; on the other hoof, he really didn’t want to find out what methods they employed besides the threat of force.\n\nOne of the officers sighed and rummaged in her pockets, “Let me read one of the tips for you.” She pulled out a piece of paper and unfurled it, “Here we are: ‘Moonspeaker Hard Term has been preaching about the importance of harmony in his sermons. I thought that was something that Celestia preached…’ so on and so forth. We ignored the first note or two that we received on this matter as you are one of the Nightmare’s chosen few, but we’ve had several more than that since.”\n\nThe zebra sighed and hung his head, having known that something like this would happen eventually.

You all know why you’re here and so do I, but I make no exceptions on the basis of mutual understanding. At this moment in time, every single one of you is a heretic; but Her Majesty, in her infinite wisdom, has granted you all a unique opportunity. Given that you’re all here, you’ve also elected to take said opportunity over rotting in a cell.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, none of them responded.

Lunar Hail had experienced a mix of emotions following the failed invasion of Tobuck; quiet distress had rapidly turned into a renewed vigour once Alesia had accepted their proposal. Now she served the Nightmare and another of her ordained servants, the Tsaritsa of Novaya Severyana.\n\n“Oh most holy Nightmare above, make me a pony of prayer and use me to bless this congregation with my life. Pour out the essence of the night upon me and give me strength. Nightmare, please rebuke the sun and its false idol that wills to keep us in bondage. Give us victory over the unfaithful through the power of the eternal moon,”\n\nShe didn’t bother looking up, knowing that the attendees both inside and outside of the cathedral would have their heads bowed as her voice boomed through loudspeakers.

May the united voice of your people rise up to the moon itself in a mighty chorus of praise!”\n\nThousands of voices chanted back, “Nightmare bless the faithful and her chosen.”\n\nThe Moonspeaker couldn’t help but smile then as she went on, “We believe in one deity, the Nightmare almighty, maker of dreams who for us and for our salvation came down from the moon and shall again return. Almighty Nightmare, our refuge, fountain of wisdom and tower of strength who knows that we can do nothing without her guidance and help; assist us and direct us with divine wisdom and power, so that we may accomplish our ordained duty as your subjects.”"

There was a little tension in the air perhaps, a few things that Dull Blade still wasn’t overly comfortable with like the portraits of the Tsaritsa beside those of the Nightmare.\n\nThe Chiropterran batpony stopped mid-walk and mid-thought to laugh quietly to herself then, realising that she had called Alesia the Tsaritsa without a second thought. Maybe she really was getting used to all that had happened after all. She quickly resumed her trot with a slight smile and found herself on the high street a few minutes later; it was the time of the week for Grocery shopping.\n\nFrankly Dull wasn’t used to all this choice. Her Majesty, there it was again, had actually allowed the shops to fully restock for the first time in years. Constant military austerity was, as far as she could tell, a thing of the past. That wasn’t to say that the military wasn’t big or powerful of course, but something at the top had changed; something that made her life easier.\n\nShe sauntered into one of three food stores in her village and began perusing the isles, finding many other ponies looking as surprised as she felt. The batpony and seemingly most of her village didn’t even recognise most of these new consumables, but they certainly wanted to try them. She shook her mane out of her eyes and added the usual weekly items to her basket before continuing to add several more foods she had never heard of, which was when she finally looked at the prices.\n\nShe spoke out loud in complete shock, “How much cheaper?

Alesia was quite excited herself, considering she hadn’t yet had the opportunity to witness the legions in a setting where they weren’t shooting at her.\n\nThere were somewhere between sixty and eighty creatures on the training field, performing a variety of exercises. Apparently these were new recruits, though she wouldn’t have been able to tell. Their discipline was already seemingly unbreakable despite the fact that they had reportedly only been in the recruitment pipeline for a few weeks at this point. Their drill instructor spotted the observing pair and ordered a quick change to sparring, which looked more like each pair was actively trying to kill one another rather than training. Their speed and skill with anything from blades and small arms to hooves and wings was incredible.\n\nLightning looked up from her clipboard,“Will that be all, Warmistress?”"

She laughed, shook it off and the pair embraced for a moment before she cleaned her face and returned to her household chores, taking extra care when dusting off the Tsaritsa’s portrait. It was still quite strange to her that, over a period of a few weeks, her friends and family had started referring to Alesia like that; but it was becoming slowly familiar.\n\n“What is my darling Zaaef doing back at the house at this hour?” She mused aloud, fishing for a particular response.\n\nHe was already pouring two glasses of wine as he spoke, “Well I asked for a half-day’s leave from the factory so that I could take you out this evening; it’s our anniversary tonight, after all.”\n\nThat got the desired reaction.\n\n“Well you’d best get washed and changed, hadn’t you? I’m not going to kiss you out and about if you look like that!” She shot back with a grin.\n\nHe dashed off to the bedroom and she called after him,"

Normally he would have been curled up, careful not to damage any of his wares that were typically stacked up around him. He hadn’t been totally cleaned out in his most recent visit to the new imperial capital, but the space around him was proof enough that he’d sold a lot more than usual. In fact, most of the remaining weight back here were goods that the stallion had purchased himself.  \n\nHe hadn’t earned this much in a day for more than a decade.\n\nYet, in spite of this payday, Silk was conflicted. He was a Warzenan  zebra, not a Tobuckian and certainly not a Severyanian one. His new overlords were zealous, proud, disciplined and traditional; but they had also brought stability and revitalised both the import and export market that he needed to survive.\n\nReally though, when he thought about it, he had already taken a side. By not opposing the new status quo and profiting from it he had effectively resigned himself to service of Warzenia’s enemies by default.\n\nThe zebra grunted and turned on his pillow, trying not to think about it."

tobuck_alesia.24.d:0 "'HALT!' bellowed the feldfebel. 'Aten-SHUN!' Initially, upon being assigned command of a company of fresh troops for the Tsaritsa's Yasani Guard, he was insulted, thinking them little more than bullies and paramilitary thugs, hardly befitting a seasoned Severyanian exile officer such as himself. So far, however, they had exceeded his expectations. His little platoon of zebras was excellently well turned-out in their dark uniforms. The feldfebel was still amazed that they could possibly stand the heat in all black. Then again, they were Zarantian zebras, natives to these arid climes, and he wasn't. He was very supportive of their retention of the sword as a weapon alongside the rifle, feeling it preserved some shred of honour. The old colt admired a warrior who had the courage to wield one on a modern battlefield.\n\nThe troops had now formed into two files. They were in the front room of the local army headquarters, and several bureaucrats and top brass officers were peering from their offices down the hall towards them, to see what the noise was about. On the wall in front of the squad was a newly-installed painting of Her Imperial Majesty, the Tsaritsa. The feldfebel roared 'Left FACE!', quickly followed by 'Pre-sent ARMS!' and it was done in under a second. 'At my command, you will salute your Tsaritsa and pledge loyalty to her as long as you may live! Sa-LUTE!' The platoon roared back, in their strongly accented voices; 'WE SALUTE YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY, AND PLEDGE TO SERVE YOU UNTO DEATH!'\n\nAs they did, the underofficer dipped the colours and the feldfebel saluted with his sabre, following along with the salute and oath. As the echo from the hallway faded the feldfebel shouted,'Right then! Shoulder arms! Left face! By the left, quick march!' The platoon marched off, their hooves kicking characteristically high as they stepped. The feldfebel looked smugly at the desk workers withdrawing their heads back into their offices like snails into their shells. They were stuck here all day, pen-pushing and paper-stacking, yet he had the privilege to put his life on the line for Tsaritsa and company. He looked back to the marching zebras and thought; THOSE are the warriors I would choose on that day, the desk-dwellers can keep their comfortable cubicles." #sirnori

tobuck_alesia.25.t:0 "Fate of the Labourers"
tobuck_alesia.25.d:0 "Alesia sat in a meeting where a fierce argument raged over the issue of the labourers, with the table divided between Chiropterran and Severyan officials. The former wished to continue the old labour system to its due end, justifying the choice as means to the end of rapid industrial reconstruction and frequently pointed out that freed labourers could become a potential security risk. The Severyans argued that even a short-term reliance on slavery would hinder the economic growth across the tsardom, especially as Tobuck continues to industrialize. In the end she slammed her hoof onto the convention table to call on a silence for a decision, tired of the endless bickering that seemed to follow her wherever she went.\n\n"I have no fondness for either the reality or idea of indentured servitude; even Old Severyana, flawed as it may have been, had no need nor want of slaves. However, it is true that the institution could serve as a slingshot into future prosperity should it last a little longer." The mare reasoned loudly, instantly surpressing the displeasure in the room.\n\nShe pondered the choice before her for a moment before giving her answer."

Though some historians asses the original Severyana as imperfect in a number of ways, the chaos and confusion caused by Steel Stallion and his comrades undeniably caused more economic, cultural and social damage than their communist ideals can hope to fix. Their revolution was brutal, unnecessary and has resulted in a factionalist government far more unstable than the one it sought to replace.”\n\nHis teacher smiled and nodded before continuing, “Thank you Egor. We also noted that Alesia and her government have rectified or simply avoided all of the mistakes that our ancestors made, which is covered in our textbook as part of the next topic ‘Lessons Learned’ if you wish to read ahead.”\n\nA few nodded, acknowledging what was to be a homework task for them. Lebedintseva was a strict teacher with that sort of thing, but she got you the grades you needed.\n\nShe cleared her throat and lifted her own copy of the text, “Now, today’s lesson will focus on another reason as to why the homeland fell to ruin. Namely, Celestia and her ties to the revolutionaries.”\n\nA few of the students turned up their snouts reflexively whilst others smirked in anticipation for their opportunity to slander that living scum."

tobuck_alesia.27.d:0 "“Oho... This… This!”\n\nKonstantin was so awestruck that he could hardly provide a proper description of what he liked so much about the painting. He held a hoof to his snout and grinned, seemingly transformed from a well-respected noble back into the excitable colt that he had been when he first saw pieces like this on his family estate. She might even have been the same painter, though there was no way to know for sure.\n\n“Enamoured, sir?” The old artist joked, dragging the stallion out of his stupor.\n\nThe noble cleared his throat before speaking again in a more serious tone, “I must admit that I am. I would like to sponsor your work, missus...?”\n\n“Ivanova, sir. Anzhelina Ivanova. I would be honoured to work for you and the Tsaritsa.” She answered, bowing to the appropriate depth despite her age.\n\nHe spent the next half an hour engrossed in her other works, ignoring the noise of the hall. Like many others ponies here that had escaped the lost homeland she had either produced some form of fine art for nobility before the revolution or was capable of emulating it. At the behest of the Tsaritsa all creative types that could prove themselves capable were to find themselves patronage and work for a number of years; creating new masterworks to revitalise the old Severyanian traditions of painting, sculpting, architecture and more."

tobuck_alesia.28.d:0 "Konstantin had never felt anything like this before. It was a mixture of pride and disgust, the former mostly for himself and the latter for what he was witnessing.\n\nWith his considerable reserves of personal wealth and the new laws of the Tsaritsa, he was obligated as a landed and wealthy stallion to assist the meek in society and work with them for a few days of the year. This was a concept he supported in and of itself, but he hadn’t quite prepared himself for the realities of the lowly and destitute.\n\nThe still-young noble had to watch silently as old, ill, disfigured and truly hurt ponies and zebras of all ages entered through the front door of the venue wearing tattered rags. He quickly got used to their awful smell the longer he served them food and acclimatised to the lack of respect as he took them to their beds. He knew now just how lucky he was to be born into his position and why the tsaritsa had demanded these measures. They ate as though they had never before eaten, slept as though they never had a bed and moved as though every part of their body was turning to dust.\n\nSeeing what he had seen, knowing what he knew now, he would never again neglect his duty to even the most detestable of Severyanian society. If only a small expenditure on his part could save lives and lost souls, it was the very least he could do."

tobuck_alesia.29.d:0 "“Lower the rent, up the pay! Lower the rent, up the pay! Lower the rent, up the pay!”\n\nThey just kept chanting and chanting. It had been a few days now since her tenant peasants had first refused to work the fields, but Serafina Nikolaeva was far from giving in to their demands. She was a noble and the Tsaritsa along with her personal security detail at the gate would protect her from this rabble of miserable wretches. Who were they to tell her how much she should pay and how much she should charge?\n\nJust as she had that thought, a familiar noise met her ears. A carriage, assumedly containing a judicial herald, and two trucks which would be carrying their soldiers. She stood up and trotted over to her mansion’s front gate with a smug grin. The gaggle of peasants had heard too and the look of defeat on their faces was already present; now they would finally leave her in peace.\n\nWhen the carriage and its vehicular procession arrived, the herald and his soldiers exited quickly to meet both the now demoralised peasants and Serafina who had decided to greet them; thinking that she had already won.\n\nHowever, instead of exchanging pleasantries, the judicial herald cleared his throat and spoke; flanked by armed soldiers. “In the case brought to us by Lady Nikolaeya, the local judge and court has reached a verdict: Lady Nikoloaeya, you are found guilty of charging exploitative rent prices and underpaying your labour force. According to Her Majesty’s decree, you must reimburse said labour force for the equivalent of six months’ rent and double the salaries of these fine citizens.”\n\nUtter shock followed on both sides. Then the crowd erupted into cheers as the noblepony exploded with rage, hurling insults and threats at the herald until his entourage levelled their guns at her.\n\n“Madame, are you protesting the perfect law of Her Majesty and the Nightmare?” He asked simply, prompting her own guards to stand down."

Between generals, nobles, industrialists and whoever else they had deemed important enough to invite they had already managed to tired out at least one of her appendages. That didn’t bode well for the evening as a whole.\n\nAn older pony, ex-Severyanian military by the looks, suddenly took her attention away from the doors. “Your Majesty, I didn’t have a chance to properly introduce myself on the way in! My name is Pyotr Luchnikov; here, I have a gift for you.”\n\nIn spite of the restrictions on weapons he had brought in a sword, likely by hiding it underneath his greatcoat in some way. The guards around them were already rushing to arrest him as he presented his weapon to the Tsaritsa, unsheathing it and offering the weapon as a gesture of fidelity. Before they could grab him, Alesia held up a hoof and ordered them to wait; even allowing herself to laugh at the absurdity of what he had just done.\n\nShe took the weapon, inspected it, sheathed it and then passed it back. “Your offer is kind and accepted, however I must ask why you decided to completely ignore our rule of no arms on the premises; was it in your interests to be arrested?”\n\n“I am of the opinion that such a rule is entirely unnecessary. Why should I, or any of your other loyal subjects for that matter, raise my weapon at my liege?” He asked rhetorically, rising from his bow.\n\nHer Majesty couldn’t help but laugh a second time before waving away the guards."

It’s been a long time since we were young lovers running through the streets Koloda, time has flown by.”\n\nhe laughed loudly and practically threw himself onto a garden cushion, next to the lunch that his wife had just put on the garden table. They both sighed and stared at the Novaya Severyanian flag that he, in his patriotism, had attached to the back of the vehicle.\n\nThe pegasus mare chuckled and sat down next to him as he began to eat, savouring the taste of the food that had been made with their own crops along with some flowers that she had bought as a special treat. They had been relatively rich peasant famers in Equus, but was a far better that life had ever been in spite of the occupational similarities. The opportunity for a better life had called them here, now they were reaping the rewards of that making the right choices in that fateful time in their lives.\n\n“This is definitely better.

I’ll make sure to broaden my knowledge for the future.”\n\nAlesia simply nodded and smiled, in as comforting a fashion as she could manage. There was no reason to punish a servant for this, they were still getting used to the new way of doing things after all. Much like herself, really. She still wasn’t used to hearing the already-present cheers from the crowd in the palace grounds, she still wasn’t used to being treated like royalty and she certainly still wasn’t used to being treated like some sort of holy messenger from the Nightmare. But, as time went on, she felt more at home here as a ruler and a guiding figure. It was hard, but it was rewarding.\n\nThere was much to do yet, eradicating communism and securing her borders in a more permanent fashion were the two things that sprung to mind immediately. For today however, those goals could wait. For today, she could enjoy herself.\n\n“Your Highness, we’re finished.” The zebra said quietly, a smile forming on his face.\n\nShe made a little bow in thanks before stepping towards the window doors and the balcony. The Tsaritsa steadied herself before throwing them open and receiving an onslaught of cheers and prayers from her adoring subjects."

They wish to align themselves with our government in a formal military alliance with the primary goal of confiscating Hippogriffia’s mainland territories. For our efforts we shall receive part of Zumidia, as they will; an equal share of territory in the event of our victory.\n\nNovaya Severyana is an autocratic, zealous and nationalistic state which is currently governed by the Tsaritsa Alesia whose power is absolute; they worship the Nightmare and proselytise their religion to any zebra they can get their hooves on. Whilst this may make them a potential ideological threat in the future, their military prowess and successes in recent conflicts suggest that the risk may be worthwhile taking. So long as we respect Tsaritsa Alesia and her personal endeavours, which she has insinuated shall not interfere with our own interests, they may prove themselves invaluable.\n\nWhat shall our response be?"

[HIP.GetLeader], leader of our uniting enemy, will no doubt speak out against us for our openly hostile rhetoric; but it is already far too late for them to establish an opposing alliance."

Curses and insults were being thrown around the war room, directed primarily at [CTH.GetLeader] for making such an idiotic decision.\n\nThough equally as frustrated as the officers that packed the room, the Tsaritsa was nevertheless determined to complete the task she had laid out. Hippogriffia represented a serious threat to her regime and now, she realised, so did Colthage. The royal mare slammed a hoof down on one of the wooden desks to bring the room’s attention to her.\n\n“Inaction is tantamount to defeat. Modify our invasion plans to account for this setback and continue preparations; now that they are aware of our intentions they will begin to reorganise, we must strike now or we may not have another chance at success.”\n\nTheir rage had not disappeared, but she had given them focus; Novaya Severyana would not be humiliated.

Should you acquiesce, the legions will likely cease their activity within a few days when they hear of our support for your regime.” She quickly added.\n\nThe pair had not expected this. The Moonspeaker’s reasoning was muddy at best; but then they did have to justify such a crushing defeat to their people as well as to their own faith. Lunar Hail herself commanded a legion, which gave further credence to their earnestness; even then, Alesia could see the desperation hidden behind their eyes.\n\nEntin thrust a hoof into her side and gave her a pained look, “Please tell me you’re not one of these insane Nightmare worshippers.”\n\nShe stayed silent. Her parents had been and, though she had never fully accepted their faith, she had never been entirely opposed to it either. She wasn’t, but maybe she would have to be. Maybe.\n\n“Please, I deserve at least an answer.” He pleaded.\n\nShe shot down his request with a harsh glare and turned, lifting her head to the clear night sky to stare at the dim stars and the moon emerging from a small cloud; hoping silently that he could forgive her for this.

Technically speaking they were on the payroll of the state, but Pea Shooter had failed to actually provide any sort of funding. This issue needed resolving as soon as possible, lest the commanders run out of surplus loot to tide over their soldiers with.\n\nTwo ideas had been proposed, one from the troops themselves and another from their generals. The former simply wanted to be paid in regular money as they were having difficulties making use of their spoils of war when trying to buy goods in stores or in sending cash back to their families; their solution was merely to finalise the state contracts and earn their keep that way. Their officers meanwhile had other ideas, instead suggesting that their pay should be granted in the form of shares in state-owned mining companies. That way they could slowly earn more over time as the businesses expanded, leading to a greater eventual payday.\n\nBoth concepts were viable, leaving the decision ultimately up to the administration."

Faced with such a boiling desire for revival and renewal of the faith, §YAlesia§! has called a grand council to talk of matters of faith. Despite the allure of a great spiritual meeting between the §CMoonspeakers§! and their new heraldess of dusk, the council is also at its core a matter of base politics. Two factions have emerged among the §CMoonspeakers§! which §YAlesia§! will have to contend with according to her interests. Both seek a return to the spirit of the early days of the faith but couldn't be more different as how they seek to return to it.\n\nThe §gRevivalist§! believe that §CChiropterran§! society as a whole grew compromising and lax and so, as they seek the revival of §YNightmare Moon§!, their diagnosis is that the faith should be as she left it. Sacred traditions ought to be restored and stand unquestioned, protected by §CMoonspeakers§! acting as guardians of the dogma.\n\nThe §FWaxists§! on the other hoof call upon the image of the waxing moon, explaining that it was the §CMoonspeakers§! themselves rather than society who grew blinded by a twisted and erratic interpretation of the faith.

### Ideas ###

TBK_fake_republic:0 "The Fake Republic"
TBK_fake_republic_desc:0 "Tobuck! A free, modern and sovereign republic! The only issue is that no Tobuckian actually wanted one. Or rather, the few who did want one certainly didn't want some gun runner to run it. In a land that happily thrived under a monarchy, the announcement of the republic landed like a cannonball shot with not enough gunpowder: making a big “thud” in the mud.\n\nIn the end, nopony was really fooled by the proclamation of the republic, even the Hippogriffian and Maregyptian ambassadors who were still happy to give lip service to the idea that Chiropterra, Warzena and Zarantia ought to think twice about moving in. But bits help smooth things over and a fake republic has a way of streamlining government decision."

TBK_warlord_reliance:0 "Warlord Reliance"
TBK_warlord_reliance_desc:0 "When Tobuck proclaimed its independence, it had no army, just mercenaries, a lot of guns and some bits. With their charm, Pea Shooter and Vasile Cel Tradat managed to convinced a few promising adventurer and costly friends to set up their own forces. Each was given a provincial governorate to male their job of defending the country easier. And while it did provide an effective defending forces, there might be some issues in relying on warlords."

TBK_zarantian_loyalism:0 "Zarantian Loyalism"
TBK_zarantian_loyalism_desc:0 "A former Warzenan province, Tobuck soured on its historical master for many a reason. And so, when queens of the desert came and liberated them, they embraced her as their savior. It proved a successful choice as the Zarantian wished for a richer region to use as their center of power. The Storm King brought an end to the promising future of the Kingdom of Zarantia and Tobuck had its fate decided for them by a clique of innovative businesscreatures as they call themselves. In the end, it's not hard to understand why the merchants and citizens of Tobuck have a nostalgia for the Zebra Queen of the east. And should Mekiouzza come for them, they will help her."

TBK_home_act:0 "The Home Act"
TBK_home_act_desc:0 "TL;DR an oper border between Tobuck and Zarantia to please the locals."

Each was given a provincial governorate to male their job of defending the country easier. And while it did provide an effective defending forces, there might be some issues in relying on warlords.\n\nThe recent chaos following Pea Shooter's disappearence has broken all trust between the warlords and central government, leading to total anarchy within the countryside."

TBK_aristocrat_control_desc:0 "The rulers of Warzena always maintained their power through an influential and loyal court. We have restored this tradition by granting the alienated nobilty still residing in tobuck their old titles in return for vesting their resources and influence in our lord. The leopard dynasty shall once again be mighty!"

TBK_wardens_recruitment:0 "Charge of the Wardens"
TBK_wardens_recruitment_desc:0 "The Oath Wardens are a force spoken of only in legend, but under Baragzen's guidance their exploits shall become very real indeed.

TBK_wardens_recruitment_expanded_2:0 "Charge of the Wardens"
TBK_wardens_recruitment_expanded_2_desc:0 "The Oath Wardens are a force spoken of only in legend, but under Baragzen's guidance their exploits shall become very real indeed. In spite of their initial conception as an all-zebra force Baragzen has deemed it necessary to begin recruiting ponies to its ranks, expanding the elite units and giving them a broader pool of potential recuits and expertise."

TBK_royal_authority:0 "Power of the Royalty"
TBK_royal_authority_desc:0 "Our lord Baragzen has absolute power over his realm; a feat achieved partly through force, propaganda and some quick legal changes. His authority has garnered many benefits for the state as a result of his policy of total control, not least for the fact that his administration is substantially more efficient than its republican predecessor."

TBK_bat_loot:0 "Vast Chiropterran Loot"
TBK_bat_loot_desc:0 "If one were to ask a hoofsoldier what good the occupation of Chiropterra has done for the country, they would likely show you a rucksack full of valuables instead of giving a verbal response. Our brave soldiery are brining back immense wealth for themselves, the country and their families, at the expense of the Chiropterrans of course."

TBK_warzena_secret_revolt:0 "Sly Insurrection"
TBK_warzena_secret_revolt_desc:0 "Something isn't right. Every order that we try to send to send to the marshals seems to be going missing and the administration is in complete disarray; something is unfolding amongst the nobility and their friends in high place and it's leaving us open to attack!"

TBK_warzena_open_revolt:0 "Popular Uprising"
TBK_warzena_open_revolt_desc:0 "The streets are full of protesting zebras and the rail lines aren't being operated! Our infrastructure and the disorganised parts of the army are in complete disarray; something has stirred the masses and it's leaving us vulnerable to attack!"

TBK_royal_authority_expanded:0 "Power of the Royalty"
TBK_royal_authority_expanded_desc:0 "Our lord Baragzen has absolute power over his realm; a feat achieved partly with military might, charisma and immense effort. His authority has garnered many benefits for the state as a result of his policy of total control, not least for the fact that his administration has no checks and balances to prevent quick legislative changes."

TBK_baragzen_army_idea:0 "The Great Royal Army"
TBK_baragzen_army_idea_desc:0 "From the undisciplined forces of a mercenary army into the glorious force it is now - that is the story of our lord's armed forces. They are unmatched in their skill, dedication and strategic prowess as demonstrated by their many timeless victories over the enemeis of the true king."

TBK_baragzen_saviour:0 "Saviour of Tobuck"
TBK_baragzen_saviour_desc:0 "Our lord has fended off the vile bats to the west, utterly annihlating the armies of the once-great Chiropterra. Truly he is the saviour or Tobuck and all of Zebrican ponykind, his actions speak for themselves!"

TBK_baragzen_protector:0 "Protector of Ponies"
TBK_baragzen_protector_desc:0 "Our lord has adopted the title Custodian of Tobuck as the protector of all ponies there, reclaiming his birthright as the true king of Warzena. Whilst his ancestors once bore such a title, never before has it been so well earned."

TBK_confusing_war:0 "Confusing War"
TBK_confusing_war_desc:0 "The current conflict between Warzena and Tobuck is quite a mess. The premise claimed by Baragzen, ruler of Tobuck, is restoration of his rightful kingship in Warzena, action supported by elements in Warzena. Due to this, some foreign observers claim the war is, in fact, a extensive civil war within Warzena, especially as Warzena claims parts of Tobuck. For now, any foreign involvement is simply out of consideration until diplomatic channels can be cleared."

### Alesia ideas

TBK_defence_state_desc:0 "The nation is still weak and thusly the state shall be strengthened to protect it. In the defence of the people, Alesia and her government will hold firm."

TBK_severyan_exile_army:0 "Old Severyan Valour"
TBK_severyan_exile_army_desc:0 "We shall defend our new home as though it was Severyana itself, with all the strength and might of our people. Though we silently mourn what was lost in Equus, it is our duty to protect what remains with renewed vigour and tempered pride."

TBK_exile_aid:0 "The Émigré Aid"
TBK_exile_aid_desc:0 "The experience, diligence and wealth of our returning friends remains the stable foundation upon which we rebuild our great nation. Our home away from home shall be mighty and awe-inspiring, as Severyana once was."

TBK_bat_resistance:0 "Chiropterran Resistance"
TBK_bat_resistance_desc:0 "Surprising nopony, the Chiropterrans are not in the least bit pleased with our policy of integration. Whilst our citizens will be happy to embrace a nationalism and identity that they never had, Her Majesty's new subjects are proving far harder to convince."

TBK_bat_resistance_lowered_1:0 "Chiropterran Resistance"
TBK_bat_resistance_lowered_1_desc:0 "Though progress is slow, we are beginning to see the fruits of our labour.

TBK_bat_resistance_lowered_2:0 "Chiropterran Resistance"
TBK_bat_resistance_lowered_2_desc:0 "The end is now in sight. Across the nation, the Tsaritsa's portrait hangs in homes beside another of the Nightmare. The last vestiges of the old, separate and lesser Tobuckian and Chiropterran societies are gradually disappearing; phased out in favour of our new cultural amalgam."

TBK_bat_distrust:0 "Chiropterran Distrust"
TBK_bat_distrust_desc:0 "It is no shock to the administration that the Chiropterrans are far from thrilled to accept their conquerors with open hooves. Aside from their issues with rapid cultural change, they are equally as averse to our ponies which has resulted in a lack of societal cohesion."

TBK_national_faith:0 "Faith In the Nightmare"
TBK_national_faith_desc:0 "Unity of belief can be just as strong as a unity of peoples in language and culture. Our faith binds us together, for Tsaritsa and the Nightmare!"

TBK_national_faith_final_desc:0 "We live to worship the Nightmare, to worship her in whatever form she may take and to serve the Tsaritsa who shall guide us and lead us to greatness in the name of our goddess. All glory to the Tsaritsa and to the inescapable truth of the Nightmare’s gospel!"

TBK_orthodoxy_purges:0 "Purge of Heretics"
TBK_orthodoxy_purges_desc:0 "Integrating the heretical Moonspeakers shall be a long, laborious and likely ineffective endeavour. Instead, we shall resort to the simplest method: a purge of the unfaithful and unholy. Even if some survive they shall obey our every command, fearing for their lives."

TBK_orthodoxy_reconciliation:0 "Clerical Dialogues"
TBK_orthodoxy_reconciliation_desc:0 "Though the hardliners amongst them may say otherwise, the Tsaritsa has deemed it imperative that reconciliation with heretic Moonspeakers should be undertaken where possible. It will be beneficial in the long term not to alienate these individuals and maintain the stability of the faith."

TBK_defence_state_expanded:0 "National Defence-State"
TBK_defence_state_expanded_desc:0 "The state has once again extended its powers for the good of the nation. Large numbers of reserves have been trained and even larger weapon caches are ready to be opened at a moment's notice if our borders are ever threatened."

TBK_defence_state_final:0 "National Defence-State"
TBK_defence_state_final_desc:0 "The state now exercises its maximum possible authority over the nation’s perpetual military readiness. Outside forces shall stampede headfirst into our impenetrable defences, then crumble under the weight of our military might."

TBK_moon_imperial_army_final_desc:0 "Dedication, effective organisation and incredible discipline are the defining qualities of our glorious armed forces. The Severyan Imperial Army shall be unmatched in efficacy and splendour."

TBK_curative_sciences_faculty:0 "Imperial Curative Sciences Faculty"
TBK_curative_sciences_faculty_desc:0 "The Tsaritsa has seen fit to create a group of researchers and a facility in which she may observe their work. Though esoteric and expensive, their studies do occasionally yield fascinating results."

TBK_caravan_trade:0 "Trans-Zebrahan Trade"
TBK_caravan_trade_desc:0 "There is always something to be gained in trade networks. We have established posts and caravans in the Zebraha with the sole intent of buying and selling goods to further fill the state coffers."

TBK_yasani:0 "Abashanyye Yasani"
TBK_yasani_desc:0 "Nopony wants to look outside and see the Abashanyye Yasani walking the streets. Their tribalistic mannerisms and endless loyalty to the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare make them a terrifying force and one that is immensely effective at quelling dissent."

TBK_tsaritsas_hoof_idea_lar:0 "Agents of Tsaritsa"
TBK_tsaritsas_hoof_idea_lar_desc:0 "The expansion of the secret service has provided us with more resources with which we may exert our influence over other nations and maintain order in our own."

Our vast and impregnable counterintelligence network provides the nation with a kind of protection that is seldom seen in the modern world."

TBK_alesia_laws:0 "Laws of Alesia"
TBK_alesia_laws_desc:0 "The combined law of Tobuck and Chiropterra was, to put it bluntly, a mess. The Tsaritsa has simplified and re-ratifying both texts into one comprehensible document for our home away from home. Now she is the ultimate authority on law and order, the supreme justice of the realm."

TBK_alesia_laws_slavery:0 "Laws of Alesia"
TBK_alesia_laws_slavery_desc:0 "Her Majesty Alesia has dictated that the Labourers shall remain state property for the time being.

TBK_alesia_laws_freedom:0 "Laws of Alesia"
TBK_alesia_laws_freedom_desc:0 "Her Majesty Alesia has dictated that the Labourers be freed from their indentured servitude immediately. Though they will find themselves members of the lowest class nonetheless, their first taste of freedom will keep them loyal for centuries to come."

TBK_social_classes:0 "True Social Order"
TBK_social_classes_desc:0 "A newly entrenched and rigid social structure perpetuates the hierarchical nature of the Tsaritsa's regime; she, at the apex of the pyramid, may not be challenged in her authority. Social mobility is almost non-existent, which should keep the lowest denomination of society in their place."

TBK_state_controlled_monopolies:0 "State Monopolies"
TBK_state_controlled_monopolies_desc:0 "Though the state may have delegated some economic responsibilities to the nobility and other members of court, we shall ourselves acquire some industries using the Tsaritsa's coffers in order to ensure that certain crucial areas of the economy remain in trusted hooves."

TBK_new_homeland:0 "Reborn Severyana"
TBK_new_homeland_desc:0 "And so it is that an ancient state and social order has been restored. It is reborn not in its original place or form, but in a new and more appropriate manner as necessary for our way of life; new and yet old, not forgotten but evolved."

TBK_severyan_absolutism_arts:0 "Severyan Absolutism"
TBK_severyan_absolutism_arts_desc:0 "It is expected of all nobility that they should uphold the cultural heritage of our nation and build upon it.

TBK_severyan_absolutism_arts_final_desc:0 "The army is and has always been the institution of the state in which nobles may prove their worth to the people. Victories bring promotion and fame whilst their war poetry never fails to beautifully represent our revanchism and eventual victory."

TBK_severyan_absolutism_example:0 "Severyan Absolutism"
TBK_severyan_absolutism_example_desc:0 "It is expected of all nobility that they should uphold their part of the social fabric by making their responsibilities known and seen by the lower classes.

TBK_severyan_absolutism_example_final:0 "Severyan Absolutism"
TBK_severyan_absolutism_example_final_desc:0 "The army is and has always been the institution of the state in which nobles may prove their worth to the people. Victories bring promotion and fame whilst they prove their dedication to our citizens in battle."

Who doesn't love a charismatic merc?"

TBK_raiders_on_wheels:0 "Nitro Tactics"
TBK_raiders_on_wheels_desc:0 "Trucks are incredible and precious vehicles, made no less valubale by the numerous and varied decorations that our soldiers have a tendency to give them.

pea_shooter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of November 962 in Trottingham\n\n§YBiography§!: When Pea Shooter was just a foal, one could hardly picture the cheerful little one to become a gun runner. With a loving family, the loveliest of childhood crush turned happy wife and good prospect as a shipping merchant between St. Petershoof and Skyfall. But still, even with all of that, little Pea Shooter was bored.\n\nIt could have all ended with a simple middle-aged pony finding a hobby or drinking the occasional excessive cider but then came the Stalliongrad Revolution. His family's business was ruined but Pea Shooter saw an opportunity. With the help of a shady friend, he bought some guns from a Fezeran smuggler and travelled back home, selling them to a communist volunteer group. And also one Severyanian counter-revolutionary he had met in a bar. He made good bit on those deals and decided to make it his career. He travelled to Haukland, making some deals there before finding his way south, wherever there were bits and a need for gunpowder.\n\nIn 1005, he made his way to Zebrica, looking to make bank on that insane Yeti whilst he was still on a roll. He failed as the Storm King died and his conquest spree ended the following year. But! He was in Tobuck with some friends and it just so happened that one of those friends had friends guarding the supply depots in the region. And with half of Zebrica in turmoil, Pea Shooter exactly knew where to find his clientele.\n\nWith the help of Vasil Cel Tradat, he helped bring about the independence of Tobuck, the birth of harmonic republicanism in the region, found some pony to become its face while he became foreign affairs minister. As long as there was guns to sell in Tobuck, there would be business to do there for any good gun-runner.\n\nAnd Pea Shooter is more than a good one.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

baragzen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of July 975 in Zammar\n\n§YBiography§!: Baragzen is an exiled noble hailing originally from Warzena and now residing in Tobuck with dreams of one day returning to his home country. Much of his early life was spent in courtly education and becoming accustomed to his role as the heir to the head of the Leopard dynasty Waseem, his father. Most seemed to think that the family had been kept away from rule for so long that they were no longer relevant and Waseem seemingly agreed.\n\nAs he grew older, the young zebra began to slowly drift away from his family’s dynastic policy of simple acceptance and instead started preparing for his family’s ‘inevitable’ return to power. When his father passed, he became head of the family to little opposition or applause; his mother, Raaniya, attempted to persuade him to abandon his dreams of ascending the throne which resulted in a heated falling out. With no support even within his own immediate family, he ran away with a large part of the family coffers.\n\nThis would land him - and the significant amount of wealth he managed to smuggle out - in Tobuck which was a hotbed of instability and conflict during and following the rule of Storm King. There he would raise a small private army, one which grew rapidly as his renown and skill became widely known amongst mercenary circles. His success came partly from a natural talent which was being explored at the time of his exile in a military academy, but it was additionally thanks to the absolute loyalty that he commanded in his soldiers. He treated them with respect and dignity, even going so far as to enter the fray himself when his force was much smaller and commanding from the field.\n\nDuring the dissolution of the Storm King’s realm and the establishment of Tobuck, Pea Shooter hired him in essence to ensure that he couldn’t cause any trouble. Now Baragzen thrives as a warlord, commanding an irregular but disciplined force. He still hopes to return to Wazerna and reclaim his birthright, but only time and a little luck will tell if he can achieve that dream.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

### Commander descriptions ###

TBK_clam_chowder_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of September 973 in Applelaide\n\n§YBiography§!: Clam Chowder is, like almost all mercenaries in Tobuck, a foreigner. Born in faraway New Mareland, she enlisted in the navy there as soon as her age permitted it but was repeatedly turned down for promotions thanks to her difficult relationship with whichever superior was unlucky enough to have her on board. Eventually her attitude would get her discharged which prompted her to steal a ship, a story she refuses to give details on, and sail off to find a navy in which her skill would be more appreciated and where discipline was more of a suggestion.\n\nDespite initially seeing her arrival in Tobuck as an opportunity to make a name for herself, the mare has mellowed significantly over the years. Needless to say that she has also become a better and significantly more professional commander as a result, but she still dreams of commanding a larger fleet than the pitiful number of ships in the Tobuckian fleet. She may yet get her wish.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanManDraws"

TBK_great_pyre_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of June 954 in Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: A selfless duty does not always bring glory and rewards to a soldier. Great Pyre witnessed this in 995, during the Severyana Revolution, where he fought as a sergeant in the Royal Guard. Only to be let go amongst other soldiers and officers for their actions in the fight against the communist revolutionaries. Instead of a peaceful life in Equestria, Great Pyre, bitter to the princess, left Equestria in the ranks of his fellow soldiers and joined with them in Zebrica as mercenaries, fighting not for glory but cold-hard cash.\n\n Yet service in the grand mercenary company was not enough for the ambitious stallion and he, with a core cadre of subordinates and local recruits, left to form their own mercenary band. This groud soon gained a ferocious reputation for their brutality and callous regard for life, bot theirs and the enemies. Rumours continued to swell, until across Northern Zebrica the company was dubbed the Band of Flayers: a name originally meant to mock their lust for loot to the point of looting the dead admist battle, Great Pyre eagerly adopted the name and further modified it by adding to it a motto. One which all members of the Band of Flayers adhered to.\n\n Down to the last fur!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_entin_miron_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of October 970 in St. Petershoof\n\n§YBiography§!: Entin Miron is, in many ways, much like his commanding officer and friend Alesia Snezhnaya. He served in the Severyanan armed forces alongside her, spending years together in the academy and fighting the red rebels during the revolution. Intelligent, brave and dedicated; when observing the two working together many assume that the pair are related despite the differences in appearance.\n\nThough some believe otherwise, it was not the money or the loyalty to the exile cause that drove him to Zebrica. In fact, rather aptly, it was by her request that he boarded a ship and set sail for the southernmost continent. They have spent years in the north of the continent, fighting through innumerable wars including those waged in vain against the Storm King.\n\nThough he is skilled and, privately, wishes for a higher position in the military; most importantly he wants to look after his friend, no matter what she may get herself into.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_pyotr_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of February 957 in Princessyn\n\n§YBiography§!: Pyotr is a pony of much mystery, yet of great renown. Little is known of his service in Severyana beyond the fact that he was retired at the outset of the revolution and was called back into service for its duration. Having heard of Alesia’s great successes in Zebrica he saw no reason not to see the great resurgence of his homeland abroad for himself.\n\nThough his strategy is outdated, his manner and personality are a welcome departure from the seriousness of modern war. Already he has made many genuine friends amongst the emerging nobility and the court, including the Tsartisa herself who has taken quite a liking to the old Stallion.\n\nMany wonder whether he has any real goals or even a desire for promotion, but really he seems to be having a wonderful time as is.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

TBK_cherry_bomb_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 26th of June 972 in Equestria\n\n§YBiography§!:Cherry Bomb's family had made fireworks for generations, and nopony expected him to do anything else. At least not until the explosion. A giant novelty firecracker went off in his face when he was twelve, leaving him with a severe concussion, damaged hearing and a nervous twitch that never quite went away. Yet where others saw an accident, Cherry Bomb found his purpose.\n\nExperimenting with more and more extreme forms of explosives, he soon changed profession to developing explosives for the Equestrian military, only to be disillusioned with them as well due to their conservative approach. Instead, he left for abroad to offer his services as a freelancer. Whether it's in New Mareland blowing up Cockatrice nests, trying to sell the Brodfeld monarchy a new line of explosives or hobnobbing with Colthaginian patricians to secure funding for private arms factories, Cherry Bomb has done it all, and he prides himself on bringing explosions from the factory to the field.\n\nHis crew is a wild mix of all sorts of people, with Cherry Bomb having few qualms about who he works with. If you love explosives as much as he does, you'll have a job with his crew as they continue in their quest to discover and make use of every explosive in the world.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_spell_stock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st October 979 in Northern Wittenland\n\n§YBiography§!: Spell Stock was always a troublemaker, even as a child, and age has not mellowed him out. Though of noble Wittenlandic birth and great wealth, his proclivities - causing scandals wherever he went, harassing the serfs by sniping at them from his palace and hunting monsters rather than tending to his property - were always an eyesore even for the other nobles. It all came to a head with White Star's ascension to the throne. Many had hoped she'd put him straight, but instead Spell Stock surrendered his property to the crown for a sizable sum and left Wittenland.\n\nTaking to the road, he used his wealth to build up a cadre of fellow hunters with the goal to hunt every monster the world had seen. Yet, in a steadily worsening world, he started to wonder if it wasn't the sapient creatures who were the true monsters. If it was, that meant that his hunting list had expanded something fierce. What more, it turned out being a mercenary paid better than a freelance hunter.\n\nHaving just finished a stint in Skyfall, he's arrived in Zebrica with a brand new "Rarity For You" suit, a vastly expanded hunting cadre and a plan to get himself trophies of every kind of threatening beast the continent can offer, and why yes that ambiguity was quite intentional.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_captain_z_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of March 968 in Colthage\n\n§YBiography§!: Once a highly respected Colthaginian officer, Bodzamal Aben commanded some of the nation's fiercest soldiers. He could have become a legend, but he made the mistake of going after the crime organisation known as the Tiger Syndicate. Though he scored several victories against them, corruption and moles within his unit led to him almost dying after being seduced by the wife of the Tiger Syndicate's leader.\n\nBarely escaping with his life, he saw how the fight against the syndicate slowly died out without him and bitterly concluded that they had patrician backing. He abandoned Colthage and has since become a gun for hire under the moniker "Captain Z". It was what he did best, and he liked doing it, so he decided it was time to make money off it instead of bleeding for a nation that seemed so willing to discard him.\n\nWhat more, one day he might have the money and the soldiers needed to go back and finish what he started. It's some ways off yet, but he's got a long time. The dead are patient, after all. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_oborin_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 23rd of March 985 in Ravenskoye \n\n§YBiography§!: In truth, Oborin was nothing more than a junior officer at one of the Stalliongradian naval academies. Though talented, his career had hardly even started when he was given the offer of going overseas to some backwater state in Zebrica. Maybe it was his yearning for action, his barely-kempt brazenness or even the desire to impress his commanders; but he accepted the call to action nonetheless.\n\nHe was greeted with a small navy on arrival and a pang of disappointment when he realised why the senior officers hadn’t been given this position overseas. Yet, thanks to assurances from Wallnut and some of his other staff, the young admiral is hopeful. Perhaps he’ll amount to greatness yet, much to the assumed annoyance of his superiors back at home.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanManDraws"
