[h1]“In the Shadow of Mountains” 1.8[/h1]

Follow the Griffking upstream from Griffenheim and you will find the Knightly Order of Hellquill. At the fringes of griffon territory, the knights will soon have to decide how to deal with the legacy of their founders. Will they carve out a new empire for the griffons, or will they turn a new page in the relationship between the races?

Far beyond that frontier, the Republic of Bakara has tamed the waves of the great seas. Master shipbuilders and proud democrats, these ponies were eager to embrace the River Coalition. Decades later, a disillusioned Bakara faces a controversial election. 

The Kingdom of Wittenland, where Queen White Star presides over a noble class of unicorns, is one of the states Bakarans are disappointed in. Although the Queen has taken measures to make her Kingdom a freer society, this only made her vulnerable to both conservatives and those wanting more radical change. The southern part of Wittenland, the especially uninviting, and de-facto independent mountain province of Barrad, is the most worrisome part of the Kingdom. Reports speak of more than just the actions of a particularly cruel mage. Erratic weather patterns and the schemes of unorthodox mages make Barrad a place to avoid for the cautious, or attractive to the foolhardy. 

South of Barrad, where storms still come from the sea, lay two domains who trace their origins beyond the sea. Austurland, is a colony of deer, where the traditions of the vikingr and the seers are still practiced. A new jarl is set to rise to power in the nation, who will shape the country in her image. To the west lies Kása, a society formed by the descendants of freed slaves and all those others who seek freedom. With tyranny lurking over every border, the nation must be prudent and strong in its ideals if it wishes to survive.

Eastern Griffonia does not lack ambitious creatures, but those with ambition know that in the shadow of the mountain, ambition is one step away from catastrophe.
